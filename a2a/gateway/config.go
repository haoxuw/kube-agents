	// shipped configuration routes everything to "platform" (the W7 bridge
	// executes) and spawns no session pods — the W4 switch is this setting,
	// not surgery.
	DefaultAddressee string

	// SpawnSessions arms the session-pod path (spawn/rehydrate/sweep with
	// client-go). Off until W4's worker image exists; the gateway pod has no
	// service-account token until this arms, so the k8s client is built

	// IdleTTL is the reap threshold since the last user message (decided
	// 8/24: 30 minutes, config-backed).
	IdleTTL time.Duration

	// AttributionSalt keys the HMAC pseudonyms in authority blocks. The
	// salt is SESSION_KV_SALT, the one the install already provisions into
	// platform-agent-secrets (settled 8/31, spec-chatops-gateway.md): the
	// shipped attribution path hashes session metadata with it, so hashing
	// with anything else silently breaks the cross-surface audit join this
	// pseudonym exists to preserve — one human, one value, on the bus and
	// in session metadata. The env-var fallbacks below are playground
	// posture for installs without that Secret, and the derived one
	// (HKDF-SHA-256 over the bus password) is a recorded deviation on two
	// counts: the broken join, and a de-anonymization key handed to whoever
	// holds the bus password. HKDF is the construction a credential is
	// permitted to pass through, and that is all it is: it answers neither
	// count, and it is not a password hash — no work factor, so it does not
	// make a weak hand-set NATS_PASSWORD any harder to guess from a leaked
	// salt. Provisioning the Secret is what fixes that.
	AttributionSalt []byte

	// TaskDeadline mirrors the worker adapter's task deadline — the SAME
	// env the adapter reads (A2A_TASK_DEADLINE_SECONDS, integer seconds),
	// because the spawner renders it onto the worker pod alongside the
	// pod-level activeDeadlineSeconds it sizes above it, and two knobs for
	// one contract would drift. Unset means 1800s, the adapter's own
	// default. The adapter kills the harness and publishes the terminal at
	// this deadline; the pod deadline (this plus a fixed grace) is the
	// backstop that hands a wedged ADAPTER to Sweep instead of letting it
	// hold its bus credential indefinitely. Raising it buys longer tasks at
	// the price of how long a wedged worker can hold a cap slot; lowering
	// it turns long-running asks into failed tasks sooner.
	TaskDeadline time.Duration

	// AskTTL bounds the active task's `ask` copy in session-state
	// (A2A_ASK_TTL). The copy's stated justification — the same text rides
	// the W-bounded stream and the copy dies at the terminal event — holds
	// only where a terminal event is guaranteed, and the spec names the
	// case where it is not (a wedged adapter, until every pod carries its
	// deadline; fixed-route executors have no janitor until stage 3). So
	// the record gets an independent bound: the reap scan clears an ask
	// older than this, leaving the task record itself intact. Unset means
	// 24h — far above any legitimate task's runtime, well under the
	// stream's 72h retention, so the KV copy always has the shorter
	// horizon the content posture claims. Raising it toward the stream
	// retention erodes exactly that claim; lowering it only trims how long
	// a status card can echo the ask.
	AskTTL time.Duration

	// FirstEventGrace bounds how long an active task with NOTHING on its
	// events subject may hold a conversation's serialization
	// (A2A_FIRST_EVENT_GRACE). Every other bound assumes a pod: the adapter's
	// deadline runs from task start inside the worker, the pod deadline from
	// pod start, and Sweep watches pod phases — so a task whose executor
	// never came up (a spawn that never happened, a bus that dropped between
	// the two publishes, a gateway restart mid-turn) has no events for the
	// heal in handleInbound to see a terminal in, and the record steers every
	// later message into it. Past this grace the heal treats "no events" as
	// "never started" and releases the serialization; it publishes no
	// terminal for the task, because age alone is not evidence. Unset
	// means 10 minutes: the spec's cold start is 5-10s and the pod deadline's
	// pre-start budget (podDeadlineGrace, the image pull before the process
	// starts) is 10 minutes, so a task still legitimately pre-first-event at
	// this age is a pod that will not be coming up. Lowering it risks
	// releasing a slow-starting worker's task out from under it — the next
	// turn then starts a second task while the first may still emit;
	// raising it is how long a user waits before the conversation answers
	// again. Values under 1m are refused at boot.
	FirstEventGrace time.Duration

	// OwnerDeployment names the gateway's own Deployment
	// (A2A_OWNER_DEPLOYMENT; the operator renders its own render's name).
	// When set, every spawned session pod carries an ownerReference to it,
	// so Kubernetes GC reaps sessions when the Deployment goes — cleanupA2A
	// deleting the gateway, or any other deletion — with no operator
	// exception to its IsControlledBy refusal. Empty (playground) spawns
	// unowned pods, the pre-S9 posture.
	OwnerDeployment string

	// Namespace, WorkerImage, and NATSCredsSecret configure the dark spawn
	// path; the secret holds the worker user's password for spawned pods.
	Namespace       string
	WorkerImage     string
	NATSCredsSecret string

	// MaxSessions caps how many session pods run concurrently, gateway-wide
	// (A2A_MAX_SESSIONS). "Delegate:" makes pod creation user-triggerable and
	// threads are free, so the principal map bounds WHO can spawn and this
	// bounds HOW MANY - without it, one mapped user's afternoon can fill the
	// namespace. At the cap a new delegation (or a session-routed first ask)
	// is refused with a chat reply naming the numbers; nothing queues,
	// nothing drops silently.
	//
	// Zero means 10, the harness spike's "busy day": at the worker shape's
	// requests (250m/512Mi) ten concurrent sessions hold 2.5 CPU / 5Gi, which
	// a small dev cluster absorbs without preemption. Raising it buys more
	// concurrent delegations at that per-pod price plus model-quota
	// contention; lowering it turns busy-hour delegations into refusals
	// sooner - a UX decision, not a safety one, because this cap is the
	// usability half. The enforcement half is the namespace ResourceQuota
	// the operator renders above this number (a compromised or buggy gateway
	// ignores its own cap and cannot ignore that one), which is also what
	// bounds the count-then-create race between concurrent conversations.
