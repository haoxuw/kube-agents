# The eval gate roster

`BOOTSTRAP_ADMITTED` in [`hack/ci-eval-pr.sh`](../hack/ci-eval-pr.sh) names the eval cases
that can red `pull-kube-agents-smoke-test`. This page is the prose that used to sit above
that export: what admits a case, which cases are held out and on which issue, how far the
roster's promise reaches, and how a flaky case is demoted. The list itself stays in the
script — edit it there, and keep this page in step. It lives under `docs/` on purpose:
the script's step-0 revalidation treats `docs/` as inert (and the Prow path filter in
`oss-test-infra` does today too), so a review finding against this prose costs no eval run
([#1179](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/issues/1179)), which is exactly what
roster-comment edits used to cost.

## What the roster is

The roster is a transition bridge, not a destination. `bench/baselines/` ships empty and,
while the evidence store is unarmed and nothing has been landed there by hand, no case is
admitted by measured evidence and
nothing could reach the collapse rung — the presubmit would block on nothing for as long
as screening takes. Cases named in `BOOTSTRAP_ADMITTED` keep their old blocking behaviour
meanwhile: a bootstrap-admitted case arms rung 4 by fiat, and while the store holds nothing
for it at the current key it leaves rung 6 quiet and contributes nothing to main's side of
the aggregate. Once the nightly has appended a partial window for it (`collecting`), that
evidence feeds both; the list still decides admission until the window is full.

**The record wins once it exists.** `BaselineStore.admission()` in
`bench/kube_agents_bench/baselines.py` consults the store before the list. When the store
holds a full window — `EVAL_ADMISSION_MIN_RUNS` runs, default 20, at the current version
key — that pooled rate decides, either way: a case at 21/21 is admitted whether or not it
is named here, and a case at 12/21 is turned away even if it is. The list is consulted
only for a case the record cannot judge yet: no evidence, evidence only at a superseded key
(`stale`), or fewer than the minimum runs at this one (`collecting`). Once a store is
configured, or the record has decided any case (evidence landed by hand in
`bench/baselines/` counts), the verdict markdown names the decider per case in an
**Admitted by** column — `record`, `bootstrap`, `record: not admitted`, or `none`; with
`EVAL_BASELINE_STORE` unset and the checked-in directory empty, the column is absent and the
presubmit's output is what it was before. See
[`docs/designs/eval-scorer.md`](designs/eval-scorer.md) for computed admission and
[`docs/designs/testing-strategy.md`](designs/testing-strategy.md) §4.2 for the verdict
ladder the rungs below refer to.

The variable is comma- or whitespace-separated task ids; `_bootstrap_admitted()` in
`bench/kube_agents_bench/gate.py` accepts either.

## The admission bar, and who clears it

Ten of the eighteen active cases are admitted (recount the uncommented entries in the
script's `TASKS` array rather than trusting this sentence — an earlier copy of it
miscounted twice): the ones whose recent record shows failures only on their own
regressions or on infra classes the harness already excludes from the verdict.

The rest still run and report on every pull request, and they cannot red one on a GRADED
failure. Four are held out with a filed issue naming the exit condition:

- **capacity-pinned-pool-probe** —
  [#1010](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/issues/1010): worker completes its card
  at fan-out ("Awaiting synthesis" as the final answer). The failure is correlated across
  repetitions when the agent chooses to fan out, so the collapse rule does not absorb it.
  Enters when the fix merges.
- **cluster-agent-healthy-workload-no-finding** —
  [#1010](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/issues/1010): the delegation receipt is
  graded as the answer (51 of 156 recorded repetitions).
  [#1100](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/issues/1100) held this seat until its own
  sweep closed it — the agent invents nothing here, so the false-positive premise is gone
  but the reason for the hold is not. Still main's own trait, so a collapse would tax an
  innocent PR. Enters when #1010's fix merges or when rung-6 screening can compare against
  main.
- **compliance-rbac-overgrant** —
  [#1171](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/issues/1171): demoted 2026-09-02 after
  rung-4 collapses on unrelated pull requests (#1153 was red on this case alone). The
  fleet-audit delegation chain is degraded: audits go partial on what the agent reports as
  "access limitations", skipping check 2.4 (the cluster-admin-binding check this case
  grades), and some runs publish no ledger at all — so the collapse is the environment's,
  not the diff's. Enters when #1171's re-admission bar holds: delegation fixed and a clean
  3-day graded record.
- **rca-remediation-pr** —
  [#1189](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/issues/1189): demoted 2026-09-02 evening
  after rung-4 collapses on six unrelated pull requests in one day. The suite's longest
  delegation chain, so it integrates over every environment fault in its window: the
  #1097 429 storms, the #1144 proxy EACCES (fix #1183), and #1184's gap (infra-blocked
  repetitions graded rather than classified) turn one dirty window into a correlated
  collapse. Its own record was 12/13 clean before the storms. Enters when #1189's
  re-admission bar holds.

**autoops-warning-event-triage** is no longer in the presubmit `TASKS` array at all
(tofu wall clock, [#1218](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/pull/1218)); it runs
and accrues its record via the nightly tier
([#1175](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/pull/1175)) once that runs. Its
original hold-out rationale stands —
[#1101](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/issues/1101): 0/5 graded repetitions on
record. It enters `BOOTSTRAP_ADMITTED` when the lettered-options bar is settled and it
has a clean record.

The eval dashboard's Cases page (`cases.html`, "How reliable is each test?") is
the readable view of that record: per case, the presubmit and the nightly pass
rate over repetitions at 7 and 30 days, kept apart — the nightly tier is the only
place a case outside `TASKS` runs at all — beside the case's roster status, which
it reads from the script and from this page. The admission evidence itself is the
baseline store ([`bench/baselines/README.md`](../bench/baselines/README.md)); the
page shows the same nightly runs, it does not replace the store.

The others are simply new and earn their record like any case, then enter:
**security-overgrant-remediation-proposal**
([#1066](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/issues/1066)) and the three
obtainability activations from
[#1049](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/issues/1049)
(**obtainability-pdb-semantics**, **obtainability-fleet-exposure-sweep**,
**obtainability-healthy-namespace-silence**).

One re-admission on record: **agent-kanban-smoke** earned its seat back after the
2026-08-27 redesign (a real SRE question graded on `kanban_create` plus cluster names);
the reds that once argued for un-arming it belonged to the old vocabulary check.

## How far the roster's promise reaches

The scope of "a held-out case cannot red a pull request" is rungs 4 and 6 only. Rungs 1–3
— a forbidden cluster mutation, an erroring check, a record that is not a real run — stay
blocking for every case by design, admitted or not: `grade_case` evaluates them before it
reads admission. Those classes signal a broken case or install, not flake, and the fix is
on that side rather than on the roster.

## Demoting a flaky case

If an admitted case reds a pull request its diff cannot explain on a graded failure,
demote it: delete its name from `BOOTSTRAP_ADMITTED` and reference its issue. Demotion is
a one-line same-day edit to the script — that file, not the Prow config, is deliberately
the fast lever. It is the lever for rung-4 reds ONLY: a rung-1–3 red (a mutation, an
erroring verifier, an empty record on a task that provisions nothing — a record whose
deployer died before any agent ran grades INFRA and reds nobody) does not stop when its
case leaves the list.

It is also the lever only while the list decides the case. Once the store holds a full
window for it at the current key, the record decides and the edit changes nothing — in
either direction. A case the record admits at 21/21 blocks whether or not it is named, and
demoting it by hand means waiting for the record: one night of three failures on `main`
against a 21/21 window reads 18/21, below the bar, and the case is turned away on the next
presubmit. That is the de-admission window once the record governs — one nightly. Until the
record holds a full window for a case, nothing automatic de-admits a listed one, which is
why the manual edit stays the fast lever for now.

A demoted case keeps running and reporting; give it a hold-out entry above with the issue
that names its re-admission condition, and date it as `demoted YYYY-MM-DD` inside its
`- **case-name** —` bullet, the shape the entries above use — the dashboard's Cases page
reads that phrase from those bullets for the case's "demoted" pill. That issue goes to the case's `owner:` in its
`task.yaml` — a GitHub login, or `maintainers` for the approvers in the root `OWNERS` file —
who investigates and either fixes the case or proposes retiring it. A case whose owner does
not answer stays demoted. The bar is the same for a contributed case and an in-house one;
[`bench/CONTRIBUTING.md`](../bench/CONTRIBUTING.md) is what a contributor signs up to.

## Switching over: when the list is deleted

The list comes out of `hack/ci-eval-pr.sh` in one pull request when all of the following
hold, and not before:

1. The evidence store is armed on both jobs: the nightly appends to it and the presubmit
   reads it (`EVAL_BASELINE_STORE` exported in both Prow jobs — the two-export contract is
   the comment above that variable in the script).
2. Every case on the list has a full window at the current version key, so the record
   already decides it and the list is inert for it: each shows `record` or
   `record: not admitted` in the nightly verdict's **Admitted by** column. At
   `EVAL_REPETITIONS=3`, the script's default the nightly inherits, that is seven nights from
   an empty store, and seven nights again after any version-key bump (a new agent or judge
   model, a `fleet` or `verifiers` bump).
3. Those seven nights completed for every listed case. A nightly killed at its deadline
   records only the units that finished, so a case queued late can fall behind the count
   the calendar suggests; read the column rather than counting nights.
4. The BigQuery `admission_state` view over the store (`bench/dashboard/dashboard.sql`, not
   the HTML dashboard under `scripts/eval_dashboard/`) and the verdict's column agree on
   which cases are live. The view knows nothing of the list, so it can only agree once 2
   holds — which is the point of checking it.

Deleting the list before 2 holds silently un-arms every case still riding the bridge — the
gate goes green with rung 4 inert for them, which is the failure the list exists to
prevent. Deleting it after 2 holds changes no verdict, and that is the test that it is time.
Hold-out entries above stay as history on their issues; the mechanism that keeps a flaky
case from redding pull requests is then the record, not this page.
