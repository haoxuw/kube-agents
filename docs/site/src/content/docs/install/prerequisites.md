description: What you need in place before running the kube-agents installer.
---

The shipping install path targets GKE. You'll need one working GCP project plus the standard command-line tools, and cert-manager on the cluster so the operator's admission webhooks come up cleanly, which the installer puts there for you. If the cluster already exists, it also has to meet the [cluster requirements](#cluster-requirements) below.

## Local tooling

- **Google Cloud SDK** (`gcloud`) — **576.0.0 or newer**, [install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install), authenticated: `gcloud auth login && gcloud auth application-default login`. The installer sets Managed OpenTelemetry with `--managed-otel-scope`, which reached GA in gcloud 576.0.0 (2026-07-14); on an older SDK the flag exists only on the alpha and beta tracks. The installer checks this before it touches any cloud resource — `gcloud components update` if it complains.
- **`gke-gcloud-auth-plugin`** — required for `kubectl` to authenticate to GKE clusters (`gcloud components install gke-gcloud-auth-plugin` or your OS package manager). Pre-flighted by the installer (`install.sh`).
- **Terraform** — the install engine is the [`terraform/examples/full-install`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/tree/main/terraform/examples/full-install) composition; the installer (`install.sh`) pre-flights `terraform` and offers to install it from HashiCorp's tap (Homebrew) or apt repository. It is equally the _teardown_ engine, and `./uninstall.sh` installs nothing on your behalf — with an install to tear down and no terraform, it refuses with exit 1, so a machine that has only ever run the installer's auto-install cannot tear the install down. (Against a target with no Terraform state there is nothing to destroy, so it exits 3 without needing terraform at all.)
- **`kubectl`** — [install](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/). The installer points it at the GKE cluster it creates.
- **Docker or Podman** — required for manual deployments that build images (`make -C k8s-operator docker-build`, Method 2) and the local development workflow (`make dev-rebuild-agent`, Method 3). Not required for stock installs (Methods 0 & 1).
- **Go** — required only for development workflows (running tests, building binaries, bootstrapping `controller-gen`/`kustomize` for Method 2). Not required for stock installs.
- **Bash** — the installer scripts are bash (including the `/bin/bash` macOS ships).
- **`jq`, `gh`, `helm`, `git`** — the rest of the CLI set the installer pre-flights up front and offers to install when missing.
- **`gcloud beta` component** — required when adopting an existing unencrypted cluster for CMEK (`gcloud beta services identity create`) or purging backup plans during teardown (`gcloud beta container backup-restore`). Not required for standard fresh installs.
- **`envsubst`** — only for the development Kustomize path (`make -C k8s-operator deploy-*`); usually shipped with `gettext`.

## GCP project

- A GCP project you can enable APIs on and where you can create GKE clusters, Pub/Sub topics, KMS keyrings, and IAM service accounts.
- Billing enabled on that project.
- The `Editor` or `Owner` role for the user running the installer (or a scoped set covering the resources above).

The installer enables APIs and creates all resources itself, including the cluster. You do not need to pre-provision one; if you do, the next section is what it has to look like.

## Cluster requirements

A cluster the installer creates meets every requirement here by construction, so on a fresh install there is nothing to check. A cluster somebody else made is a different matter. The composition installs onto one when `create_cluster = false`, and `install.sh` selects that on its own whenever the cluster it is pointed at already exists and this install did not create it. Some requirements are then refused at plan time, some `install.sh` meets by changing the cluster, and the rest fail after the GCP resources exist; the third column says which. Read the cluster before you point the installer at it:

```bash
CLUSTER=my-cluster LOCATION=us-central1 PROJECT=my-project
gcloud container clusters describe "$CLUSTER" --location "$LOCATION" --project "$PROJECT" \
  --format='yaml(autopilot.enabled,currentMasterVersion,workloadIdentityConfig.workloadPool,networkConfig.datapathProvider,networkPolicy.enabled,privateClusterConfig.enablePrivateEndpoint,controlPlaneEndpointsConfig.dnsEndpointConfig,databaseEncryption.state)'
gcloud container node-pools list --cluster "$CLUSTER" --location "$LOCATION" --project "$PROJECT" \
  --format='table(name,config.workloadMetadataConfig.mode,config.machineType)'
```

The first command omits a key whose value is unset, so a requirement that is not met usually shows as a missing key rather than a `false`; the second prints an empty `MODE` cell. `autopilot: {}` means a Standard cluster; `autopilot: {enabled: true}` means Autopilot.

| **GKE 1.29 or newer.** The chart's `kubeVersion` floor, for native sidecar containers. The optional `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` needs 1.30 and `AgentPlugin` OCI volumes 1.35, but both degrade rather than fail below that.                                                                                         | `currentMasterVersion`                                                                                                        | Nothing checks it up front.

| **Workload Identity pool** `PROJECT.svc.id.goog`. Every KSA-to-GSA binding the install creates rides it; without it the pods authenticate as the node's service account.                                                                                                                                             | `workloadIdentityConfig.workloadPool`                                                                                         | `install.sh` enables it, a control-plane update of several minutes. A bare Terraform run refuses the plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **GKE metadata server on every node pool.** Enabling the pool does not migrate node pools; pods on a pool still using the legacy metadata server get the node's identity. Standard only; Autopilot manages it.                                                                                                       | Every pool's `MODE` reads `GKE_METADATA`                                                                                      | `install.sh` migrates each pool that is not, **which recreates that pool's nodes**, including pools running workloads unrelated to kube-agents. Terraform does not check, and the install reports success while the pods use the wrong identity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **NetworkPolicy enforcement**: Dataplane V2, or the legacy Calico addon. Every NetworkPolicy the install ships is accepted and inert without one; GKE Standard's default has neither.                                                                                                                                | `datapathProvider: ADVANCED_DATAPATH`, or `networkPolicy.enabled: true`                                                       | `install.sh` enables the Calico addon and then enforcement, which can recreate node pools. A bare Terraform run refuses the plan. `install.sh` does not migrate a cluster to Dataplane V2, and the `FQDNNetworkPolicy` companions only enforce there with FQDN policy enabled, so on Calico they stay inert.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **A control plane reachable from where Terraform runs, and from the agent.** Terraform's Helm provider always dials the IP endpoint, so it must be public or Terraform must run inside the VPC. The agent and the installer's post-apply `kubectl` can use the DNS endpoint instead when it allows external traffic. | `enablePrivateEndpoint` unset or `false` for Terraform; for the agent, that or `dnsEndpointConfig.allowExternalTraffic: true` | Nothing checks either. A private-only IP endpoint fails the Helm provider, and enabling the DNS endpoint does not change that. On a cluster the install did not create, `allow_external_dns_traffic` does nothing; open the DNS endpoint with `gcloud container clusters update --enable-dns-access` instead. [`gke_dns_endpoint.sh`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/scripts/installer/gke_dns_endpoint.sh) explains why the flag is never passed blind. |
| **cert-manager**, present or absent, but declared either way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `kubectl get deployment cert-manager -n cert-manager`                                                                         | `install.sh` probes for it (in that namespace only) and sets `enable_cert_manager` for you; a bare Terraform run against a cluster that already has it fails on the existing CRDs unless you set it to `false`. Details [below](#cert-manager-on-the-target-cluster).                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **A gVisor RuntimeClass**, because the agent runs sandboxed by default (`--gvisor=false` opts out).                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Autopilot: `currentMasterVersion` at or above `1.27.4-gke.800`. Standard: nothing to read; the install adds it.               | `install.sh` refuses an older Autopilot cluster before applying anything. On Standard the composition creates a `gvisor-pool` node pool of one `e2-standard-4` per zone: new billable capacity, and it carries GKE's sandbox taint, so only the sandboxed agent lands there. A cluster that already has a pool of that name needs `gvisor_pool_name` changed; the module never adopts one.                                                                                  |
| **Schedulable capacity for the workloads the install adds.** A stock install requests under 2 vCPU and about 4 GiB in total, and the agent pod alone needs more than 1 vCPU free on a single node. Hindsight memory, the dashboard, and the GitHub minter each add more.                                             | `kubectl describe nodes` allocatable minus requests, on the pools the agent can use                                           | Nothing checks it, and the failure depends on which pod is stuck. LiteLLM or the operator Pending: the Helm release waits ten minutes and fails with `context deadline exceeded`, naming nothing. Only the agent pod Pending: the operator creates it after the Helm release, so the apply succeeds and `install.sh` prints a warning naming `platform-agent-gateway` after five minutes, then reports the install complete.                                                |

Three more things the installer sets on a cluster it creates, and treats differently on one it adopts:

- **CMEK database encryption.** `install.sh` enables it on an adopted cluster too, creating a KMS keyring and key and updating the control plane, unless `ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_SECRETS=true`. `uninstall.sh` does not revert it. Bare Terraform does not require or enable it.
- **Managed OpenTelemetry collection scope.** Set only on clusters the install created; on an adopted one, follow [Enable Managed OpenTelemetry on an existing cluster](/kube-agents/reference/attribution/#enable-managed-opentelemetry-on-an-existing-cluster).
- **The Backup for GKE agent.** Only needed with `enable_gke_backup_plan = true`, which is off by default; the module cannot enable the agent on a cluster it only reads.

Run the installer with `--dry-run` to see the plan against the cluster without changing it. The installer's own cluster changes happen only on a real run, so a dry run against a cluster still missing the Workload Identity pool or NetworkPolicy enforcement stops at the plan-time refusal.

**No extra firewall rule is needed on private clusters.** The operator's webhook server listens on
`10250`, one of the two ports GKE's automatic control-plane-to-node rule already permits — see
[Admission webhooks](/kube-agents/operator/#admission-webhooks). A cluster that hardens `10250`
beyond the GKE default (scoping it to node IPs, say) still needs a rule for the webhook, or a move to
a port it does allow — which is a Kustomize patch across the `--webhook-port` flag, the manager
`containerPort`, and the Service `targetPort` together, not a single flag. Changing one of the three
leaves the API server dialing a port nothing is listening on; see
[Serving on a different port](/kube-agents/operator/#serving-on-a-different-port).

## cert-manager on the target cluster

The operator's admission webhooks need TLS certificates managed by [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io) (v1.13.0+).

**You usually do not need to install this yourself.** The Terraform composition `terraform/examples/full-install` installs cert-manager as its own `helm_release`, pinned in its `cert_manager_version` variable, including the leader-election relocation Autopilot needs. On an existing cluster that already runs cert-manager, set `enable_cert_manager = false` — the composition does not detect an existing install and the apply fails on the existing CRDs. The installer (`install.sh`) probes for a `cert-manager` Deployment on the existing-cluster path and writes that variable for you, keeping `true` when the Deployment is the composition's own release recorded in this install's Terraform state. (An existing cert-manager installed under a different namespace or release name is not detected.)

Install it by hand only if you are:

- deploying into an existing cluster without the installer or Terraform ([Manual install](/kube-agents/install/manual/)), or
- pinning a specific cert-manager version.

The Helm chart on its own is the one path that never installs cert-manager: a chart that shipped a `Certificate` into a cluster without the CRDs would fail at apply time for everyone. It therefore leaves the operator's admission webhooks off (`operator.webhooks.enabled=false`) until you install cert-manager and turn them on. See the [chart README](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/charts/kube-agents/README.md).

### Standard install (recommended)

```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --set installCRDs=true
```

### GKE Autopilot install

Autopilot blocks leader-election Leases in `kube-system`. Disable leader election during install:

```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --set installCRDs=true \
  --set controller.leaderElection.enabled=false \
  --set cainjector.leaderElection.enabled=false
```

### Manifest fallback

If Helm isn't available:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.21.1/cert-manager.yaml
```

On Autopilot you'll additionally need to patch the deployments to append `--leader-elect=false`. Because argument indices vary by cert-manager version, verify the arg list before patching — a positional JSON patch (`/args/1`) will silently corrupt an unexpected version.

## Chat platform

- **Google Chat** (opt-in, but the interactive installer pre-selects it): a GCP project with the Chat API enabled and a Chat app configured to publish events to Pub/Sub. The composition's [`chat-pubsub` module](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/tree/main/terraform/modules/chat-pubsub) creates the topic and subscription (`enable_google_chat = true`, or the installer's `--enable-google-chat`); you configure the Chat app itself in the [Chat API console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/chat.googleapis.com).
- **Slack** (opt-in): a Slack workspace where you can install a bot app and generate bot + app tokens. Follow the [Hermes Slack setup guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/slack). Slack is configured only if you enable it in the installer's chat menu (or set `enable_slack = true` in `terraform.tfvars`).

**A GCP project holds one Chat app.** Google's rule is that "each Google Chat app that you create
requires its own Google Cloud project with the Chat API enabled" —
[Configure the Chat API](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/configure-chat-api). So a
project already running a Chat app cannot also run kube-agents' Chat integration.

This only applies if Chat is on, and whether it is on by default depends on which front door you
use. Terraform and Helm both default it off — `enable_google_chat` and the chart's
`googleChat.enabled` are `false`, so neither takes a slot unless you ask. The interactive installer
goes the other way: its chat menu pre-selects **Google Chat**, so pressing enter at that prompt
provisions the Chat backend. Pick "None" or Slack there if you want the project's Chat slot left
alone. **Slack is unaffected** — it provisions no GCP resource at all, so a project whose Chat slot
is already spoken for can still run kube-agents with Slack in it.

If you do want Chat and the slot is taken, moving just the Chat backend elsewhere is not available
through the supported paths: the chart renders the CR's `projectId` from
`platformAgent.harness.projectId`, so the installer and the chart always put the Chat topic in the
cluster's project. That leaves installing into a project whose Chat slot is free — a choice worth
weighing against how you want the agent's fleet scoped, not against Chat alone.

## LLM credentials

Pick one at least:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` (recommended default; get one at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com)).
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Or route one of these keys through a self-hosted LiteLLM gateway — see [`examples/litellm-gemini/`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/tree/main/examples/litellm-gemini) for a Gemini API-key template.

## GitOps repo (for `submit-suggestion`)

The declarative workflow needs a GitHub repo to file PRs against.

- A GitHub repo **owned by an organization**. Minty looks the installation up under `/orgs/{org}/`, so a repo owned by a personal account cannot be used — see [token minter](/kube-agents/deploy/token-minter/). A free organization is enough.
- A GitHub App with `contents:write`, `pull_requests:write`, and `issues:write` permissions, installed on that repo. The App itself may be owned by the organization or by your personal account.
- The App's private key wrapped in a GCP KMS key — the [`github-minter` Terraform module](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/tree/main/terraform/modules/github-minter) creates the keyring and an import-only signing key, and the installer (`install.sh`) imports the downloaded `.pem` into it via the Minty CLI (a one-shot step, so the key material never enters Terraform state).

See [`k8s-operator/config/integrations/github/README.md`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/k8s-operator/config/integrations/github/README.md) for the full Minty setup.

## Ready to install

- [Quick start (GKE)](/kube-agents/install/quickstart-gke/) — run the installer end-to-end.
- [Manual install](/kube-agents/install/manual/) — step-by-step, no wrapper script.
