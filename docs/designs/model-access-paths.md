# Hosting the model in your cluster

> **STATUS: design of record; implemented.** The `hosted_vllm` provider (no `providers.json` row yet; see §3) ships alongside the hosted-provider path (`gemini`, `anthropic`,
> `openai`, `vertex_ai`) and the ChatGPT-subscription path (`chatgpt`), each a row in
> `k8s-operator/config/integrations/litellm/providers.json`, and a hand-applied vLLM recipe under
> `examples/vllm-gemma/`. Tracking issue: #1418.

## 1. Goal

A third way for a kube-agents user to give the agent a model, beside an API key and a
subscription: **a model server in the same cluster**, any model the server can load. Nothing is
defaulted or hard-coded: the install names the model the server was started with, the server's
address, and its pod port, the way Vertex names a project and a location.

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/vllm-gemma/      # the server, on a GPU node pool you provide
# install.env
MODEL_PROVIDER=hosted_vllm
MODEL_DEFAULT_NAME=<the model the server was started with>
HOSTED_VLLM_API_BASE=http://<service>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local/v1
HOSTED_VLLM_TARGET_PORT=<the server pod's port>
```

The agent is untouched. It speaks the OpenAI wire to `model-default` at the gateway, and only the
gateway's `model_list` knows where that alias goes
([inference gateway](../site/src/content/docs/concepts/inference-gateway.md)). The end-state
architecture already names the split: "LiteLLM proxy for hosted models (Gemini/OpenAI), vLLM for
local GPU models" ([05-system-architecture](../architecture/05-system-architecture.md) §5, C5).

## 2. Two facts that shape the design

**LiteLLM routes; it does not run a model.** It has no inference engine, so a GPU on the LiteLLM
pod does nothing unless a model server shares the pod. LiteLLM's own provider for a vLLM server
is `hosted_vllm/<model>` ([its docs](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/vllm)); it needs no key, and it reads the server address from the
`HOSTED_VLLM_API_BASE` environment variable when the config carries no `api_base`. The base
config already renders `${MODEL_PROVIDER}/${MODEL_DEFAULT_NAME}`, so `hosted_vllm/<model>` comes
out of the template that exists and the address travels as one environment variable, the way
`VERTEXAI_PROJECT` does.

**The model server is its own workload, not a sidecar.** The gateway runs two replicas behind a
PodDisruptionBudget at 100m CPU; a sidecar would mean two GPUs and two copies of the weights for
one model's throughput, and every gateway rollout would reload the model for minutes.

## 3. What ships

Everything mirrors `vertex_ai`, the provider variant already in the tree, and nothing new is
written for the server: the harness integrates an OpenAI-compatible endpoint and ships no
model-specific code, which is the line the #608 review drew.

| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chart `litellm.yaml`            | `hosted_vllm` admitted by the provider guard; three required values (`modelDefaultName`, `hostedVllm.apiBase`, `hostedVllm.targetPort`), each refused at render time when empty, the way `vertex.projectId` is; the env var beside `VERTEXAI_PROJECT`; one egress rule. |
| Installer                       | `hosted_vllm` accepted, with no default model; a fifth entry in both provider menus prompting for the three values; the two new keys round-trip through `install.env` and `terraform.tfvars`.                                                                           |
| Terraform                       | `hosted_vllm` in the `model_provider` validation; `hosted_vllm_api_base` and `hosted_vllm_target_port` passed through to the chart, no default.                                                                                                                         |
| `examples/litellm-hosted-vllm/` | `examples/litellm-gemini/` with the Gemini key replaced by the provider line and the env var: the gateway half of the pair with `examples/vllm-gemma/`.                                                                                                                 |

Left out on purpose, to keep the change small: a kustomize overlay for the dev path and a
`providers.json` row for the admin console, whose LLM-gateway page therefore shows a `hosted_vllm`
install's provider and model as Unknown until the row lands. Both are the `vertex_ai` shape again
and can follow.

The model server is `examples/vllm-gemma/`, applied by hand on a GPU node pool the user provides,
as the site's inference-gateway page already describes. Automating the node pool and the server
(node auto-provisioning in the `gke-cluster` module, the vLLM project's chart as a second
`helm_release`) was considered and left out of this change: it is where the complexity lives, and
the provider is useful without it.

## 4. Egress

The gateway's NetworkPolicy has no general private-address egress: DNS, the metadata server, the
OTLP collector, and 443 to public addresses. The `hosted_vllm` rule admits one namespace, read from
the Service name in `apiBase` the way the collector's is read from `telemetry.otlpEndpoint`, on the
configured `targetPort` (8000 in the example). On a stock install the operator renders
`litellm-policy` (#1195), so the chart stamps the pair on the PlatformAgent CR as the
`kubeagents.x-k8s.io/litellm-upstream` annotation and the reconciler appends the same rule; the
operator learns a namespace and a port, not a provider. Not every pod in the cluster, and the pod port
rather than the Service port, because the policy is evaluated after the Service's translation.
The gateway's existing 443 rule to public addresses stays under `hosted_vllm`: it is the
gateway's policy, not the provider's, the same Deployment serves whichever provider the install
selects next, and LiteLLM fetches its model-cost map over it at startup. An air-gapped install
that wants it gone has `litellm.networkPolicy` and the policy it manages itself.

## 5. Testing

- **Unit, every PR** (`tests/test_hosted_vllm_provider.py`): the chart render for `hosted_vllm`
  carries the provider line, the env var, and exactly one same-namespace egress rule on the
  configured port; each missing value fails the render naming it; the other providers render none
  of it; a URL outside the cluster fails; the rule names the namespace in the URL; the installer
  accepts the provider with no default model; the gateway example points at the server example's
  Service and port. `tests/test_installer_common.py` pins the two tfvars lines beside the Vertex ones.
- **Manual:** a live run on a GPU node, recorded in the pull request that lands a change. CI has no GPU.
- **No new eval cases.** The agent's behaviour does not change.

## 6. Sizing the server for the agent

The agent requests 65536 output tokens on every call. At the pinned Hermes that is the `custom`
provider's floor when `model.max_tokens` is unset, and the agent's rendered config leaves it unset;
vLLM rejects any request whose output budget exceeds `--max-model-len`. Two consequences:

- A server has to hold that budget plus the agent's ~20k-token prompt, so `examples/vllm-gemma/`
  serves `google/gemma-4-E4B-it` at a 131072-token context on one L4, the configuration under
  which a gateway request and a full agent turn with a tool call succeeded. A 31B checkpoint with
  FP8 weights holds 32k on two L4s and no more, and failed every turn.
- The cap could live in the agent's config instead: `model.max_tokens` in the profile config is a
  per-leaf override the operator's managed scope does not pin, so it needs no Go change, but it
  would apply to every provider, which is what the review of #608 declined. Upstream Hermes has
  since removed the floor, so a Hermes bump makes the example's context a tuning choice again.
  Until then the requirement is stated where the server is sized.
