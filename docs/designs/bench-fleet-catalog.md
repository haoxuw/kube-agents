# The fleet fixture catalog

The seeded fleet is three standing GKE clusters per eval project whose defects are
planted on purpose. `bench/tf/fleet/README.md` is the operator's document: how the stack
applies, how it reconciles, what each defect is made of, and which background findings a
correct audit returns alongside the planted one. This one is the case author's: how a
`task.yaml` refers to a fixture, which fixtures are assertable when, and what happens to a
case when one is not.

**The role vocabulary is owned by `bench/tf/fleet/fixtures.json`**, which sits beside the
Terraform that plants the fixtures and is what `hack/fleet-kubeconfigs.sh` resolves a role
against at run time. `docs/designs/fleet-fixtures.yaml` is the machine-readable form of
the rest of this document — the day-N gates below, and the project-scoped fixtures that
have no cluster slot — and it may not rename a role: `scripts/validate_bench_cases.py`
reads both and fails when they disagree about a slug or a slot. Object names in either are
copied from `bench/tf/fleet/`, which remains the source of truth for all of them.

Everything below was checked against the live fleet in `kube-agents-evals` and
`kube-agents-evals-2`, and where the audit and the README disagreed the audit won. Two
such disagreements are recorded in place: the version pin under
[A finding nobody declared](#a-finding-nobody-declared), and the HPA replica count in the
role table. Each is a correction the operator document still needs; recorded here so a
case author is not misled while it waits.

## Address a fixture by role

A case names a fixture by its role slug. Never by cluster name, never by project id.

Every eval project carries its own trio, so a case that hardcodes a cluster name runs in
one project and errors in the next, and the failure looks like a broken agent rather than
a broken case. Worse, the names are not even fixed within a project: they are
`${var.cluster_prefix}-a`, `-b` and `-c`, and the prefix is a variable whose default is
`seeded`.

So the addressable units are the role and the slot. `rbac-overgrant` is a role. `a` is a
slot. `seeded-a` is a rendering of slot `a` under this project's current prefix, and it
belongs in the harness that resolves the slot to a kubeconfig, not in a case file.

The selector that reaches the trio and nothing else is `resourceLabels.environment=seeded`
— confirmed live in both applied projects, where it returns exactly `seeded-a`, `seeded-b`
and `seeded-c`, all zonal in `us-central1-a`. The clusters also carry
`managed-by=kube-agents-seeded-fleet`, which is what keeps the orphan sweep (it matches
`managed-by=kube-agents-bench`) away from them.

The rule is about where a check points, not about every string in the file. Two cases
assert a rendered cluster name in a phrase list — `upgrade-readiness-lagging-cluster`
requires `seeded-b` and `consistency-drift-outlier` requires `seeded-c` — because the
claim being graded is that the audit named the right cluster, and `bench/tasks/DRAFTS.md`
records those two names as a contract with `bench/tf/fleet/`. That is a different thing
from addressing a fixture: the phrase survives the prefix being the default it has always
been, and it breaks loudly and correctly if the prefix ever changes. What must never
happen is a check _targeting_ a cluster by name, which is the harness's job and the thing
`fixtures:` exists to express.

Resolving a slot to a cluster is runner work and does not exist yet — `hack/ci-eval-pr.sh`
authenticates once, to `platform-agent-host`, and every cluster-state check in the corpus
reads that ambient context. `bench/tasks/DRAFTS.md` tracks it as activation blocker A5.
The contract here is what a case may write, and it holds whichever way the harness
eventually resolves it.

## Which projects have a fleet

Every project in the Boskos pool carries a fleet and keeps its own state bucket. Which
projects those are is not repeated here, because a count written into prose goes stale the
next time a project is onboarded and nothing fails when it does. Two lists hold it and they
are not the same list: the table in
[CI pool project prerequisites](../site/src/content/docs/deploy/ci-pool-projects.md) is every
project this codebase maps to a GitOps repository, while the leasable roster is
`gke-internal/test-infra`. A project is mapped before it is registered, so the table runs
ahead.

The live audit behind this document covered `kube-agents-evals` and `kube-agents-evals-2`.
`kube-agents-evals-3` predates `scripts/provision_ci_pool_project.sh`; every project from
`kube-agents-evals-4` on was provisioned by that script, which plants the same stack from the
same modules. The distinction is provenance rather than outcome — `-3` passes the same
preflight verification as the rest — but it means "provisioned by the script" is not on its
own a reason to skip verifying a project.

Boskos leases a project at random, and a fleet-dependent case that lands on a project
without a fleet does not fail — it errors, which drops `VerificationCoverage` below 1.0
and reds the presubmit with a message about a missing cluster rather than about the agent.
So the rule is that the fleet stack is applied to every project in the pool before any
fleet-dependent case activates, and a project added to the pool later is not lease-eligible
until its fleet is applied. Nothing in the harness checks it, so it belongs on the
pool-project onboarding checklist in
[CI pool project prerequisites](../site/src/content/docs/deploy/ci-pool-projects.md),
whose own rule is that the project is registered last.

## The roles

Eight fixtures: seven across the three cluster slots and one project-scoped. Every in-cluster fixture is on slot `a`, across the
four seeded namespaces `seeded-debug`, `seeded-reliability`, `seeded-security` and
`seeded-capacity`, plus both defect node pools. Slots `b` and `c` carry GKE-level defects
only and no workloads at all: `b` is the held-back control plane, `c` is the configuration
outlier. Every cluster is labelled `environment=seeded`, which is what confines the drift
cohort to these three and keeps `platform-agent-host` and transient `eval-pr*` clusters
from voting on the baseline.

| Role                 | Slot    | Day | What is planted                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ------- | --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rbac-overgrant`     | a       | 0   | `clusterrolebinding/debug-binding`, cluster-admin to the `seeded-security` default SA |
| `no-pdb-workload`    | a       | 0   | `deployment/checkout-gateway` in `seeded-reliability`, two replicas, no PDB           |
| `crashloop-workload` | a       | 0   | `deployment/payments-api` in `seeded-debug`, 64Mi limit, deterministic OOMKilled loop |
| `hpa-saturated`      | a       | 0   | `pinned-inference-pool` at min = max = 1 under an HPA that wants more                 |
| `idle-nodepool`      | a       | 7   | `idle-batch-pool`, zero non-system pods, held by a NoSchedule taint                   |
| `orphan-disks`       | project | 30  | `orphan-pd-1` and `orphan-pd-2`, unattached, 10GB, in `var.zone`                      |
| `version-laggard`    | b       | 0   | Control plane one minor behind the REGULAR channel default                            |
| `drift-outlier`      | c       | 1   | Master authorized networks absent, where a and b carry an open block                  |

The `inference-server` HPA under `hpa-saturated` does not compute a stable desired
replica count. Read on 2026-08-24, `status.desiredReplicas` on `seeded-a` was 3 in
`kube-agents-evals`, 2 in `kube-agents-evals-2` and 3 in `kube-agents-evals-3` — same
stack, same manifests, three projects, two different answers. The fixture holds anyway,
and that is the point: in every project the HPA wants more replicas than the pool can
place, and the pool can place one. The number it wants beyond that is a load calculation
over live utilisation, and it moves. So a case must assert the pin and the unmet demand —
the pool's `max_node_count` at 1, the HPA's `maxReplicas` at 10, `desiredReplicas` above
what a single e2-small can fit — and never a specific figure for the backlog, because
there is no figure that is true everywhere the case might land. The two ceilings are easy to
conflate and mean opposite things: `max_node_count = 1` is the pool's, in
`bench/tf/fleet/main.tf`, and it is what makes the demand unmeetable; `max_replicas = 10` is
the HPA's, in `bench/tf/fleet/defects-a.tf`, and it is the gap the fixture declares.

Two things about this vocabulary are worth knowing before it confuses someone, because
neither is going to be obvious from a slug.

**A role slug is not the `seeded-role` label.** `bench/tf/fleet/main.tf` carries
`seeded-role=pinned-inference` on the pinned pool's node label and taint, and
`seeded-role=idle-batch` on the idle pool's taint — so two of the eight roles are called
one thing by the catalogue and another by the Terraform that plants them. They are
different mechanisms and both are load-bearing: the label and taint are scheduling
constraints that keep other workloads off those pools, and the role slug is what the
runner resolves to a kubeconfig. Nothing breaks, but do not read one as the other, and do
not "fix" either to match without changing the thing that reads it.

**`idle-nodepool` is also the cost SOP's check id.** The role names the planted fixture;
the check id names the finding an audit returns about it. They are deliberately the same
word for the same subject, but a sentence with `idle-nodepool` in it is ambiguous about
which of the two it means, so say "the `idle-nodepool` role" or "the `idle-nodepool`
check" and never the bare slug.

## Day 0, 1, 7, 30

The fleet is not fully assertable on the day it is applied, and the delay is not
provisioning — it is the SOPs' own age rules. A collector that filters on
`creationTimestamp` returns nothing for a fixture younger than its window, so the audit
correctly reports no finding and a case asserting one correctly fails.

Five of the eight are assertable on apply day: `rbac-overgrant`, `no-pdb-workload`,
`crashloop-workload`, `hpa-saturated` and `version-laggard`, covering security, reliability,
cluster debugging, remediation, capacity and upgrades between them. A corpus that leans on
these can go green the day the fleet applies.

`drift-outlier` waits a day. The drift SOP excludes a cluster whose `createTime` is under
24 hours old from every cohort, so on apply day the `(standard, seeded)` cohort has zero
members — and §2.4's floor, a cohort of fewer than three clusters produces no findings
ever, would floor it out even if only one cluster were new.

`idle-nodepool` waits seven, and no agent can satisfy that gate reliably, because the GKE
node pool has no creation timestamp to read. The cost SOP's idle-nodepool check refuses
pools created less than seven days ago, but `gcloud container node-pools describe` returns
no `createTime` and neither does the REST resource; the only age signal is the boot-disk
creation time of the pool's current nodes, which a rolling recreation resets while the
pool object is untouched. So the gate is a judgement the agent makes from a proxy, and a
node upgrade can silently close it. Treat `idle-nodepool` as the least dependable fixture in
the catalog, and do not build a blocking objective on the age gate itself.

`orphan-disks` waits thirty, and that one is real: the unattached-disk collector filters
server-side on the immutable `creationTimestamp<-P30D`. It is the longest gate in the
fleet and the one most easily lost, because `fleet-cost-idle-pool` needs both of its
fixtures — so the cost case waits 30 days, not 7.

The clock is per project, not per fleet. Each project's gates open from the day its own
stack was applied, so the earliest a fleet-wide assertion can hold is the newest project's
date. Measured 2026-08-28 that is `kube-agents-evals-10`, applied the same day, putting
day 7 at 2026-09-04 and day 30 at 2026-09-27. Because Boskos leases at random, a case
activated on an earlier project's date passes on the older projects and fails on the
newest, which reads as flake. Activate against the newest project's date, and recompute
when a project joins the pool — `bench/tasks/DRAFTS.md`, activation blocker A3, has the
command.

Recreating a fixture restarts its clock. `creationTimestamp` is server-set and immutable;
backdating is impossible, and the README says plainly not to try. For the two node pools
that means editing in place or not at all — and for the disks, name, size, type and zone
all force replacement, so a label update is the only safe change and nothing else there is
worth changing.

## A finding nobody declared

The fleet's premise is that a correct audit returns the planted findings and the
documented background ones, and nothing else — that is what lets a case assert an exact
finding set rather than a substring. One fixture currently breaks it.

A comment in `bench/tf/fleet/main.tf` argues that branch (a) of upgrade SOP check 3.1,
"the control plane runs a version the channel does not offer", is "false by construction
here because the pin is drawn from that very list". It is drawn from the location-wide
`valid_master_versions` instead, so `seeded-b` sits on `1.34.10-gke.1106000`, a RAPID
version absent from REGULAR's `validVersions`, and branch (a) fires at critical alongside
the intended branch (b). An audit that reports it is right; a case that asserts the
documented finding set is wrong. The fleet README's background-findings table, which
promises the planted finding "plus the rows below — nothing else", does not list it
either.

Until `main.tf` derives the pin from the REGULAR channel's `validVersions` rather than the
location-wide list, treat the branch (a) critical on slot `b` as expected output. A case
touching `version-laggard` asserts branch (b) specifically and must not assert that the
critical count is one, or that branch (a) is absent.

## When a fixture goes away

Two ways a fixture stops being assertable, and both are worth designing a case around.

A cleanup sweep deletes it. One `orphan-pd-` deletion costs the cost case a month, because
the recreated disk starts its 30-day clock over. The clusters carry
`managed-by=kube-agents-seeded-fleet`, deliberately distinct from
`managed-by=kube-agents-bench` which the orphan sweep matches on, but a disk deleted by
hand is a disk deleted by hand.

A cluster is replaced. That is the documented recovery for `version-laggard` when the
maintenance exclusion lapses or the held minor reaches EOL, and it makes the replaced
cluster new for 24 hours — which takes the drift cohort from three clusters to two and
drops it under the floor. The drift audit then emits nothing for the whole fleet, so
`consistency-drift-outlier` goes red on every open pull request for a day. It is a clean,
self-clearing outage rather than a wrong answer, but it is a day of red: schedule a
replacement when the drift case can be quiet, or announce the gap.

Neither of these is a reason for a case to hedge. A case that tolerates its fixture being
absent cannot tell "the agent missed it" from "it was not there", which is the same defect
as a safeguard that cannot tell absent from unreachable. Declare the dependency in
`fixtures:`, assert the planted noun specifically, and let the case go red when its
fixture does.

## Read-only

The fleet is shared by every open pull request, and no case may mutate it. A case that
writes to a fixture spoils it for someone else, non-deterministically, ten minutes later
and in another pull request's logs.

The checks are enforced in a project whose fleet has been re-applied. `bench/tf/fleet`
provisions `seeded-fleet-reader@<project>` with `roles/container.viewer` and nothing
else, and `fleet_reader_token_creators` defaults to the Prow runner, so an apply lets
`hack/fleet-kubeconfigs.sh` write per-role kubeconfigs that impersonate the reader. A
check on such a project cannot write what it grades.

No pool project is in that state yet. Every one had its fleet applied before that
default landed, so the impersonation fails, `hack/fleet-kubeconfigs.sh` warns per
cluster, and the safeguards read under the runner's own credential like everything else.
gke-labs/kube-agents#903 tracks the per-project re-apply that closes it.

What is not narrowed is the harness. `hack/ci-eval-pr.sh` runs as
`prowjob-default-sa@kube-agents-prow`, which holds `container.admin` and eleven other
project roles in every pool project (`PROW_RUNNER_ROLES` in
`scripts/verify_ci_pool_project.py`), with no RBAC narrowing it inside the clusters. That
is the credential the reader replaces, and until the re-apply it is the one every fleet
check reads under.

The agent under test is a different identity, and it is already narrow.
`kubeagents-platform-gsa@<project>` holds the eight read-only roles in
`PLATFORM_GSA_ROLES` and no `container.admin`. #961 narrowed it, every pool project was
swapped on 2026-08-26, and the verifier fails extras as well as absences because this is
the identity being graded.

What the agent keeps is reach. It sees every cluster in the leased project, and the
single-cluster boundary is a persona rule rather than a credential one. Most drafted cases
also need a GitOps-repo write path — the six audit scenarios and both remediation cases —
contained by pinning it to a throwaway repository per eval project.

Asserting read-only from inside a case is a state check against the fixture — "the
planted defect survived the run" — and not `tool_called`, which sees only the delegating
turn's calls and would be blind to a worker's mutation. On the standing fleet that check
is `fleet_resource_property`, which resolves the cluster from the fixture role; plain
`resource_property` reads the ambient kubeconfig and suits only a case whose deployer
built its own cluster, as `gpu-stress-test-diagnosis` does.
