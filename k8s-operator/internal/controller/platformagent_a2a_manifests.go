// it differs). A RePublish edit is a differing config, so it takes the second

// STREAM.MSG.DELETE on every stream, DIRECTORY included. One PURGE empties the
// directory for every profile and nothing repopulates it; DELETE leaves only a
// re-run of the provision Job to bring the stream back.
//
// The list is what the worker-side binaries emit, read out of nats.go and then
// measured against a real server running this render
// (TestWorkerJetStreamGrantOnARealServer). Per stream:
//
//   - TASKS: STREAM.INFO (js.Stream in lib.TasksGet and the bridge's sweep),
//     CONSUMER.CREATE (the bridge's durable through CreateOrUpdateConsumer, and
//     the replay's ordered consumer; nats.go puts the filter subject in the API
//     subject, so the grant ends in `>`), CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT (every pull), and
//     DIRECT.GET (GetLastMsgForSubject: the replay horizon and the sweep's CAS
//     baseline). Acks are $JS.ACK.TASKS.>, granted beside this list.
//   - KV_runtime-state, the bridge's in-flight registry: STREAM.INFO
//     (js.KeyValue binds a bucket by reading its stream), and CONSUMER.CREATE
//     with CONSUMER.DELETE (kv.Keys is a push ordered consumer that nats.go
//     creates and then deletes on Unsubscribe, and the sweep runs it at every
//     bridge start). Put and Delete are publishes on $KV.runtime-state.>,
//     granted beside this list. No DIRECT.GET: nothing on the path calls
//     kv.Get -- the bridge puts, deletes and lists, and the worker adapter
//     touches no bucket -- and when a caller appears the grant is
//     DIRECT.GET.KV_runtime-state.>, with the server test as the place its
//     absence shows.
//   - TOPICS-STATE and TOPICS-JOURNAL: STREAM.INFO and DIRECT.GET, reads only.
//     `a2a topics read` and `list` are js.Stream, Stream.Info and
//     GetLastMsgForSubject on these two streams (lib.ReadTopicLatest,
//     lib.TopicRegistry), and the CLI dials with whatever NATS_USER its pod
//     carries; the worker credential is what a gateway-spawned session pod
//     gets. The writes are the three exact topic subjects above this list.
//
// Reads go through DIRECT.GET and not STREAM.MSG.GET because every stream the
// provision script creates has allow_direct set: the script says
// --allow-direct on each `stream add` (natscli's default too, stated so the
// grant does not rest on one), a KV bucket always has it, and the live store
// shows it on all seven. nats.go picks the route from the stream's own config,
// so the fallback is never emitted and is not granted.
//
// What the wildcard granted that nothing on the worker path uses, and this
// list now refuses: every verb on DIRECTORY (no STREAM.INFO, no consumer, no
// DIRECT.GET -- the gateway keeps subscribe on the cards, which is the read
// discovery needs), every verb on KV_session-state and KV_cap, PURGE / UPDATE /
// DELETE / MSG.DELETE / RESTORE / SNAPSHOT on every stream, STREAM.CREATE,
// enumeration (STREAM.NAMES, STREAM.LIST, CONSUMER.NAMES, CONSUMER.LIST),
// account INFO (jetstream.New never asks for it), and CONSUMER.INFO (nothing
// on the path binds to an existing consumer by name, and on nats.go v1.53.1
// no consumer re-verifies itself with it after a reconnect either --
// TestWorkerConsumersSurviveABusRestart holds that across a server restart).
//
// CONSUMER.DELETE on TASKS is withheld, and it is the one subject nats.go
// does emit here without a grant. The only emitter is the ordered consumer's
// reset path, which fires DeleteConsumer in a goroutine and ignores the
// result; an ephemeral it could not delete is reaped by its own five-minute
// inactive threshold.
//
// Withholding it raises the price of reaching another principal's durable and
// does not close the route, which is the correction to what this comment said
// first. CONSUMER.CREATE is create-OR-UPDATE by name -- the request's `action`
// field is empty for both, and the server has no ownership concept for a
// consumer name -- so within a stream the worker may create consumers on,
// every consumer on that stream is the worker's to reconfigure. Measured
// against this render, on the gateway's relay durable: one permitted
// $JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.TASKS.gateway-relay carrying the durable's own
// config with filter_subject changed retunes it, and the gateway stops seeing
// task events with no permissions violation logged anywhere; the same subject
// carrying inactive_threshold has the server reap the durable, ack floor and
// all, while CONSUMER.DELETE is refused in the same run. That is the residue
// the web block below already records for web, on the one stream where
// another principal has a durable to aim at. It is not new -- $JS.API.>
// permitted all of it -- and no narrower grant exists: nats.go's ordered
// consumers take server-generated names, so the last token has to be `>`, and
// NATS wildcards match whole tokens, so a per-prefix grant matches a consumer
// literally named that. What closes it is the auth callout giving each
// principal its own user. DELETE stays out as the one destructive verb here
// that nothing on the worker path needs.
//
// One route this list narrows but cannot close, because it lives in a request
// body: a push consumer's deliver_subject. CONSUMER.CREATE on TASKS (or on the
// KV bucket) lets the worker ask the server to deliver that stream's messages
// onto any subject, and a stream whose subjects cover the deliver subject
// stores them -- under their ORIGINAL subjects, so this is not forgery (a
// topic or card read by subject never sees them) but it is a persisted write
// into a stream the worker has no publish grant for, and with discard=old an
// eviction lever against it. The server delivers only once a subscription
// exists whose subject is EXACTLY the deliver subject: a push consumer
// registers through Sublist.registerNotification, which takes interest only
// from a match whose `sub.subject` is byte-equal to the deliver subject, and
// says so in its own doc comment ("this interest needs to be exact and ...
// wildcards will not trigger the notifications"). Identical in 2.10.29 and
// 2.14.5, and it is what bounds the residue: a principal watching the whole
// plane is not enough, and neither is a stream's own wildcard ingest.
// Measured on both versions, that splits the streams in two. TOPICS-STATE and
// TOPICS-JOURNAL have literal subjects, so their own ingest subscription IS
// the exact match and the write lands with no help (three TASKS messages
// arrived in TOPICS-STATE under a2a.tasks.* subjects). DIRECTORY, TASKS and
// the buckets have wildcard subjects, so a client has to hold a subscription
// on the deliver subject itself -- for the directory, another principal
// subscribed to one card subject. The gateway's `a2a.agents.>` and web's
// `a2a.>` subscribe grants permit that but do not supply it: a subscription
// on either wildcard leaves DIRECTORY empty, measured. Nothing in the tree
// opens a literal card subscription today. The wildcard this replaces had the
// same route with every stream as a source; what closes it is the worker not
// holding CONSUMER.CREATE at all, which is a pre-created consumer per task
// (the stage-3 dispatcher), not a grant. The server test measures all four

// without covering a credential — a password interpolated here by any route
// other than pw is back in the digest.
//
// TestA2AConfigRolloutHashOmitsCredentialsAndTracksRotation is the guard for

// and requires the digests to be equal, so any route by which a credential
// re-enters the hashed input reds it.
// TestA2ARenderedObjectsCarryNoPasswordDigest is the wider but shallower one —
// it catches a digest of a password, or of the real conf, reaching a rendered

//
// keys carries the callout's two PUBLIC keys, which is why they travel with

// a credential, and the rollout digest has to cover it. If it did not, rotating

// StatefulSet, leaving the server trusting an issuer nothing signs with any

// it removes the completed Job, the next reconcile's create-if-absent re-runs
// the (idempotent) script under the same name, so a standing next install
// re-proves its provisioning roughly daily. That churn is one short-lived pod
// a day; the alternative — a completed Job kept forever as the done-marker —
// trades it for permanent clutter and a stale-looking object in every kubectl
// listing.
//
// The digest covers everything this function renders into the spec: the
// script, the image, the uid and security contexts, env, volumes, mounts,
// backoffLimit and the TTL. A superseded Job is not deleted here, and how it
// leaves depends on how far it got. A completed one leaves by TTL; one whose
// pod ran and failed runs out its backoffLimit and then leaves by TTL; one
// whose pod never ran — an unpullable image, an unschedulable pod, an
// admission refusal — has no terminal condition for the TTL to start from
// and stays until the mode flips or the agent is deleted, holding one slot
// in the namespace pod quota the whole time. That last case is the image
// override scenario this digest exists for, so deleting superseded
// generations by label is owed, not merely nice. What holds today: the
// status scan in reconcileA2A reads the current name only, so a stale
// failure does not park the phase, and cleanupA2A deletes by label, so a
// mode flip removes every generation at once.
//
// What the digest does not cover is what is on the bus. Creation is
// create-only convergence: the script's `info || add` lines make re-runs
// clean but do NOT edit a stream that already exists, so a retention or
// subject change in a later payload reaches fresh installs only. Migrating an
// existing install is a manual `nats stream edit` — stage 1 accepts that and
