# Websocket listener for the web user (the read-only web rail reads the bus

#
# Plain ws IS the playground posture, stated rather than implied, and stated
# accurately: the CONNECT frame carries the web password in cleartext across
# the pod network. The Service is ClusterIP, so nothing OUTSIDE the cluster
# reaches this listener — and an ingress NetworkPolicy fences the pod network
# too: 4222 from the enumerated bus clients only, and NO pod-network peer for
# 8222 or 9222. The port-forward the demo uses and the kubelet's readiness
# probe both enter from the node, which the policy does not govern, so the ws
# surface is reachable through kubectl and through nothing else. Production
# still terminates TLS in front of the bus, which is not a toggle that exists
# yet.
#
# The origin allow-list is the one thing here that is not posture. WebSockets
# are exempt from CORS, and the demo transport is a kubectl port-forward to
# 9222 on a workstation — for as long as that runs, every page the operator's
# browser visits can open a socket to localhost:9222, with a credential that
# lives in browser JS by construction.
#
# allowed_origins, NOT same_origin: same_origin compares the browser's Origin
# against this listener's own host:port, and the UI is always a page on a
# different port than the bus (vite on 5173, or an nginx port), so it can never
# match. Measured in a real browser: same_origin gives every UI deployment a
# 403 at the handshake. A CLI or Node client sends no Origin header at all,
# which both settings permit — which is exactly why this needed a browser to
# find.
#
# This is defense in depth and not a boundary: Origin is browser-asserted, so
# anything that is not a browser simply omits it. The boundary is the web

        #   $JS.ACK.>                  — an ack subject names a stream and a
        #     CONSUMER, not the caller, so web could publish +TERM onto the

//
// It is deliberately NOT a digest of the rendered nats.conf. That file carries
// all five NATS passwords, so hashing it put a truncated digest of the
// credentials in an annotation anyone who can get the StatefulSet can read —
// harmless against 32 random hex characters, an offline target the day a
// password is hand-set, and CodeQL alert 27 (go/weak-sensitive-data-hashing).
//
// Instead it covers the conf rendered with a placeholder in each password's
// place, plus the creds Secret's resourceVersion. Both halves are load-bearing:
// the placeholder render tracks every non-secret byte, so a config change still
// rolls the bus, and the resourceVersion tracks a credential rotation, which
// ensureA2ACredsSecret performs as an Update on the existing Secret — the UID
// would not move, which is why this is the resourceVersion.
//
// Two things that costs, both accepted rather than overlooked:
//
// The hash is no longer content-addressed. resourceVersion moves on ANY
// accepted write to the creds Secret, so labelling it by hand, a policy
// controller stamping the namespace, or a restore that renumbers the namespace
// rolls the single-replica bus once with nothing the server reads having
// changed — clients reconnect, and JetStream state lives on the PV. The
// alternative that ignores metadata churn is a digest of the password bytes,
// which is the alert this function exists to close, so the spurious roll is
// the price of not hashing the credential.
//
// And the rotation it notices rolls the bus, not the bus's clients. This hash
// rides the NATS pod template alone; the gateway Deployment and the provision
// Job take their passwords through valueFrom.secretKeyRef, which a running pod
// does not re-read, so a repaired credential leaves the gateway holding the old
// one until something else restarts it. That gap predates this function — the
// conf digest rolled only the StatefulSet too — and closing it means deciding
