	//   - It stops the inflow only. Kanban cards and sessions created from events
	//     already delivered keep running and still have to be dealt with on the board.
	//   - Nothing turns it back on. An install left with the watcher off has no

	// MaxInProgress caps how many kanban workers run concurrently across the whole

	//
	// Unset means 2, the operator's default — not Hermes' own behaviour, which does not
	// cap concurrency at all. The default exists because a worker is a full agent process
	// holding a few hundred MiB for the length of the task: unbounded dispatch lets a
	// burst of queued cards spawn workers until the cgroup OOM killer takes them, and
	// that kills a child process rather than the container, so it produces no Kubernetes
	// event and no restart while the dispatcher strands the card instead of retrying it.
	//
	// The cap is bought at a real price, so raise it deliberately rather than leaving it
	// alone by default. A slot is held for a worker's entire run, so capping serialises
	// minutes of model work: measured against real fan-outs on a live cluster, capping at
	// 2 roughly doubled the time for a batch to finish. One exception: a worker that is
	// only waiting on cards it fanned out does not hold a slot, or it would block the very
	// children it is waiting for. Do NOT reach for a lower value as a latency fix — an
	// uncapped fan-out does spawn every sandboxed worker at once and they contend during
	// startup, but a cap trades minutes of model work for seconds of boot. What the
	// workers contend for is not established either — CPU limit, memory
	// ceiling and gVisor I/O all fit the evidence, and gVisor hides the cgroup throttle
	// counters that would settle it — so raising resources is not a guaranteed fix;
	// measure it.
	//
	// Set it higher once a deployment has measured its own worker footprint and model
	// quota — a fleet with headroom is throttled by 2. Set it to 1 to serialise all

	// workers that exhaust their retry budget exit without calling a terminal kanban
	// tool, and the dispatcher reports that as a "protocol violation" rather than as the
	// quota exhaustion it actually is.

	MaxInProgress *int `json:"maxInProgress,omitempty"`

	// MaxSessions caps how many A2A session pods run concurrently, install-wide.
	// It only means something under mode: next - a today install renders neither
	// the gateway that spawns session pods nor this bound. "Delegate:" makes pod
	// creation user-triggerable from chat and threads are free, so the principal
	// map bounds WHO can spawn and this bounds HOW MANY.
	//
	// Unset means 10, the operator's default - a "busy day" sizing: at the
	// session-pod shape (250m CPU / 512Mi requests) ten concurrent sessions
	// hold 2.5 CPU / 5Gi, which a small dev cluster absorbs without
	// preemption.
	//
	// The number lands in two places that deliberately differ. The gateway's
	// A2A_MAX_SESSIONS env carries it as a usability control: at the cap a new
	// delegation is refused with a chat reply naming the numbers, never queued,
	// never dropped. The namespace ResourceQuota is rendered a fixed headroom
	// ABOVE it as the enforcement control: a compromised or buggy gateway
	// ignores its own cap and cannot ignore the quota, and keeping the quota
	// above the cap is what makes users hit the honest refusal rather than an
	// opaque admission failure. The quota is namespace-wide - the only shape a
	// hostile pod-creator cannot dodge - so its headroom above the cap also
	// bounds everything else in the namespace: an install whose namespace
	// carries many non-session pods can see unrelated pod creation refused at
	// admission before sessions reach this cap, and the headroom is an
	// operator constant, not a CR field.
	//
	// Raising it buys concurrent delegations at the per-pod price plus model
	// concurrency against the shared LiteLLM endpoint; the quota lifts with it.
	// Lowering it turns busy-hour delegations into refusals sooner - a lower
	// cap never reaps in-flight sessions, it only blocks new spawns until they
	// finish. Setting it to 1 serialises delegated SESSION work; kanban worker
	// concurrency is MaxInProgress above, a different lane.

	// 80, where anything that can make an HTTP request can mint the node or
	// Workload Identity service account's tokens — is one of the destinations
	// left off. That address does appear on the list once, on port 53 only:
	// under Cloud DNS for GKE it is the Pod's DNS resolver, and withholding it
	// leaves the agent unable to resolve any of the names the rest of the
	// allowlist is written in. Port 53 reaches no token.
	//
	// READ THIS BEFORE YOU BELIEVE THE NAME. THIS FIELD BLOCKS NOTHING TODAY.
	// Not the metadata server, not anything else. Setting it to Allowlist can
	// only widen what the agent Pod may send, never narrow it.
	//
	// That is not a bug in the rules below; it is what NetworkPolicy does.
	// Policies selecting one Pod are unioned — the Pod may send whatever any of
	// them permits — and the API has no deny rule, so an added policy is a
	// monotone operation. It cannot subtract. The agent Pod is already selected
	// for egress by <name>-gateway-netpol, which the operator renders on every
	// reconcile whether this field is set or not — unless
	// spec.networkPolicy.enabled is false, which withholds the gateway policy.
	// On a Helm install that makes this the Pod's only policy: the one shape
	// where this field enforces for real on an enforcing CNI, denying
	// everything off its list. A Kustomize install still carries the static
	// platform-agent-core-egress set over the same Pod, so the union resumes
	// there. Everywhere else, turning this on leaves the
	// Pod's permitted egress a strict superset of what it was. In the default
	// shape the only destination it adds is the credential broker on TCP 8765
	// — plus, when the agent is not exporting telemetry, the managed collector
	// namespace on 4317/4318, because the gateway policy omits its own OTel
	// rule in that case and this one keeps gke-managed-otel, which the Hermes
	// tracing plugin still addresses there. With an endpoint, both policies
	// name the namespace read off it. Anything egressAllowlist names is added
	// on top of that.
	//
	// What the gateway policy already permits, and therefore what this cannot
	// take away:
	//
	//   - 169.254.169.254/32 on TCP 80, plus the discovered metadata-daemon port (988 by default) to both link-local
	//     metadata addresses — the pre- and post-DNAT forms of a metadata
	//     request (the 988 rule is suppressed when the resolved metadata
	//     daemon IP is empty). So the metadata path stays open. The same
	//     address is also permitted on port 53, where it is the Cloud DNS for
	//     GKE resolver rather than a credential path.
	//   - TCP 443 to 0.0.0.0/0 minus the private ranges, unless the
	//     FQDNNetworkPolicy annotation is set. So every HTTPS destination on
	//     the public internet stays open, and with it the exfiltration half of
	//     what this control is meant to be.
	//
	// A Kustomize install additionally applies platform-agent-core-egress
	// (deploy/kustomize/platform/networkpolicy-core-egress.yaml), which selects
	// the agent Pod by app.kubernetes.io/name and permits the same metadata
	// path. A Helm install does not carry it, and it changes nothing either
	// way: the gateway policy alone is enough to make the point above.
	//
	// The overlap is deliberate rather than an oversight. Workload Identity
	// needs the metadata path, and <name>-gateway-netpol still permits it to
	// the agent Pod. Narrowing that allowance to the broker Pod, which is the
	// only one that mints a cloud token, is the work that turns this field into
	// a control.
	//
	// So what is this for today? Two things, and they are worth having, but
	// neither is enforcement. It renders an auditable statement of the
	// destinations the agent is supposed to need, in an object an operator can
	// diff and a reviewer can read. And it establishes the field, the refusal
	// rules and the reconcile behaviour, so that narrowing the gateway policy
	// later is a change to one policy rather than a new feature.
	//
	// Three conditions the operator cannot check for you.
	//
	//   - The policy does nothing at all on a cluster whose CNI does not
	//     enforce NetworkPolicy (GKE Standard without network policy enabled);
	//     Autopilot and GKE Dataplane V2 always enforce. An unenforced policy
	//     is stored and returned by kubectl exactly like an enforced one, so
	//     there is nothing for the operator to read.
	//   - Any other policy in the namespace that selects this Pod and permits
	//     wider egress re-opens what this one closes, as the two above do.
	//   - NodeLocal DNSCache, if the cluster runs it, may lose DNS entirely.
	//     It runs hostNetwork, so on Cilium and Dataplane V2 its traffic
	//     carries a host or remote-node identity, which neither the
	//     k8s-app: node-local-dns Pod selector nor the 169.254.20.10/32 CIDR
	//     peer in the rendered DNS rule is guaranteed to match. Both work on
	//     an iptables dataplane, which is why both are rendered. This is the
	//     only one of the three that can take the agent down rather than
	//     quietly weaken it — every allowlisted destination is reached by
	//     name, so no DNS means no egress at all. Check
	//     `kubectl -n kube-system get ds node-local-dns` and confirm
	//     resolution from the agent container after enabling.
	//
	// WHAT IT WILL COST, once the gateway policy is narrowed and this field
	// starts blocking things. None of the following happens today, for the
	// reason above: every destination on this list is one <name>-gateway-netpol
	// still permits to the same Pod. Read it as the bill that falls due, not as
	// the current behaviour — and do not schedule a capability review for a
	// change that will not alter anything yet.
	//
	// The allowlist covers DNS, the credential broker, LiteLLM, the namespace
	// of the OpenTelemetry collector the agent resolved, the Hindsight memory
	// API, and whatever egressAllowlist adds. Everything else the agent
	// container reaches on its own would go away:
	//
	//   - DuckDuckGo web search, which the shared default config turns on for
	//     every profile, and the "browser" toolset, which only the Chat Agent
	//     disables;
	//   - the gke and developer_knowledge MCP servers, which proxy
	//     container.googleapis.com and developerknowledge.googleapis.com;
	//   - github.com reached directly from the sandbox, though not the gh and
	//     git wrappers, which go through the broker;
	//   - the metadata lookup in cluster_agent_reconcile.py, which finds that
	//     script's project id. It fails soft after a five-second timeout and
	//     falls back to a broker gcloud call; set RECONCILE_PROJECT to skip it.
	//
	// Those would not be accidental casualties. A headless browser with
	// unrestricted egress is the exfiltration path, so the capabilities this
	// would remove are the same ones that make the control worth having. Restore
	// individual destinations with egressAllowlist.extraRules — noting that
	// NetworkPolicy matches addresses, never DNS names, so restoring a hosted
	// service means naming its address ranges.
	//
	// Credentialed gcloud, kubectl, gh and git are unaffected: they are shims
	// that call the broker, and the broker is on the allowlist.
	//
	// TURNING THIS OFF DOES NOT DELETE THE POLICY. An egress policy is a
	// guardrail, and the operator will not remove a guardrail it may not have
	// created, so setting this back to "None" leaves
	// <name>-sandbox-metadata-deny in place, still denying what it denied. To
