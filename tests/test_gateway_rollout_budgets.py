"""Tests for the platform-agent-gateway rollout budgets.

The companion to test_hindsight_probes.py, for the Deployment upgrade.sh
actually gates on -- and for scripts/release/wait_for_gke_readiness.sh,
which waits on the same Deployments after the RC environment is provisioned and
is bound by the same rule. The same three numbers have to stay in the same
order:

    startupProbe budget  <  rollout gate  <  progressDeadlineSeconds

The upper bound is the hard one. Past the deadline the Deployment reports
ProgressDeadlineExceeded and any caller's wait returns early however long it
was given, so a gate at or above the deadline buys nothing.

The gateway spent a long time violating this on both sides. Kubernetes
defaults progressDeadlineSeconds to 600s, and nothing set it, while
agentAPIProbe(10, 60) sanctions a 605s cold boot -- the kubelet was told to
tolerate a boot the Deployment gives up on. The rollout gate sat at 180s,
under both, and reported red on deploys that had succeeded: a gateway pod
measured 215s to Ready in autopush and 259s in staging.

Every number is read from the source that owns it rather than hardcoded here,
so raising one cannot leave this suite asserting against a value no install
uses.
