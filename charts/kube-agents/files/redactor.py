"""Centralised redaction and pseudonymisation for audit logs and session metadata.

Two independent jobs live here because both are needed by the same four call
sites (the two audit hooks, the session store, and the OTel bridge):

* :meth:`AuditRedactor.redact` / :meth:`AuditRedactor.redact_text` strip
  credentials and e-mail addresses out of anything on its way to stdout.
* :meth:`AuditRedactor.hmac_hash` turns a user identity into a stable
  pseudonym, so session rows and span attributes carry a hash rather than the
  address itself.

A third, optional layer sits on top of the first: :class:`RedactionRule`
objects an operator configures -- IP literals, a cluster name, a project id --
each masked or pseudonymised after the built-in credential patterns have run.
:meth:`AuditRedactor.rules_from_config` builds them from the plain mapping the
chart renders, and the LiteLLM gateway hook is the consumer today. A caller
that passes no rules sees exactly what it saw before the layer existed.

The canonical copy is `agents/chat/defaults/plugins/common/redactor.py`;
`charts/kube-agents/files/redactor.py` is a byte-identical mirror the chart
mounts into the stock LiteLLM image, because Helm cannot read outside the chart.
`tests/test_litellm_redaction.py` fails when the two drift: edit the plugin copy
and copy it over.

Deliberately *not* here: raising on a match. These helpers are called from
`pre_gateway_dispatch` and from `start_span`, so an exception — including one
from a regex false positive — would land in the message-dispatch path or in
every span the agent opens. Redaction fails open by design; the enforcement
boundary is Kubernetes RBAC and the credential proxy, not a logging hook.
