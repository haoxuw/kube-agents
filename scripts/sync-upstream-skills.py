## Required final step: provision the Cluster Agent profile

Creating a cluster is **not complete** until it has a Cluster Agent. A managed cluster and its
Cluster Agent profile are **created together** — never leave a newly created cluster without a
profile. Immediately after `create_cluster` succeeds and the cluster is reachable, create its
dedicated **Cluster Agent** profile (this is what makes the cluster delegable for runtime
debugging). Use the [cluster-agent-lifecycle](../cluster-agent-lifecycle/SKILL.md) skill:

```bash
python3 /opt/data/scripts/cluster_agent_profile.py create \\
  --project "<project>" --cluster "<cluster>" --location "<location>"
```

The command is idempotent, so it is safe to re-run. This gives the new cluster an agent
immediately. (The `cluster-agent-reconcile` cron would also pick it up on its next run — it
manages every cluster in every project in scope, so no labeling is required.)

## Cluster Agent Profile Teardown

A managed cluster and its Cluster Agent profile are **deleted together**. When a cluster is
decommissioned/deleted, also remove its dedicated **Cluster Agent** profile (created at onboarding).
Use the [cluster-agent-lifecycle](../cluster-agent-lifecycle/SKILL.md) skill:

```bash
python3 /opt/data/scripts/cluster_agent_profile.py delete \\
  --project "<project>" --cluster "<cluster>" --location "<location>"
```

Do not delete a Cluster Agent profile while its cluster still exists.

Deleting the profile here is the immediate, preferred path. As a backstop, the hourly
`cluster-agent-reconcile` job auto-prunes any profile whose cluster is definitively gone, so a
profile missed during teardown is cleaned up on the next reconcile cycle.

## Before recommending GPU/TPU or large-shape capacity

Before recommending capacity for a GPU/TPU or large-shape design, load the
[capacity-obtainability](../capacity-obtainability/SKILL.md) skill and run its diagnostics:
verify the regional quota for the exact accelerator metric (e.g. `NVIDIA_A100_GPUS`), then gather
capacity obtainability advice (`gcloud beta compute advice capacity`) for the requested machine
shape and count across the region's zones, for the Spot and Flex-Start provisioning models the
advice API accepts. That skill owns the rules for what to probe and how to report it; follow it
rather than restating them here.
""",
    "gke-networking": f"""{FOOTER_MARKER}

## Before you pass `--dns-endpoint`

The `get-credentials --dns-endpoint` example above works only on a cluster that publishes a DNS
endpoint **and** has `controlPlaneEndpointsConfig.dnsEndpointConfig.allowExternalTraffic` set to
true. Check first:

```bash
gcloud container clusters describe {{cluster_name}} --region {{region}} \\
  --format='value(controlPlaneEndpointsConfig.dnsEndpointConfig.endpoint,controlPlaneEndpointsConfig.dnsEndpointConfig.allowExternalTraffic)'
```

Do not infer support from the command succeeding. When external traffic is disabled, a caller that
Google treats as internal gets a warning rather than an error, plus a kubeconfig pointing at the
DNS endpoint that then returns HTTP 403 on first use — a failure that surfaces one step later than
its cause. `gcloud container clusters update {{cluster_name}} --enable-dns-access` turns the
setting on.

The Platform Agent's own tooling makes this decision per cluster in
`/opt/data/scripts/gke_endpoint.py`, so `switch_kube_context` and the Cluster Agent profile
scaffolding already pass the flag exactly when it applies; the check above is for the times you
run `get-credentials` by hand. That decision is re-read about once a minute per cluster, so after
enabling the setting, wait a moment before retrying rather than concluding it did not work.

## Executed version checks: the fleet-upgrade-verification skill

This skill plans one upgrade at a time; its references read one cluster at a time. When the
question is which clusters in a fleet lag a target version, by how many minors, and whether the
control plane or a node pool is the laggard, run the
[fleet-upgrade-verification](../fleet-upgrade-verification/SKILL.md) skill's script and paste its
table rather than reasoning from memory:

```bash
./skills/fleet-upgrade-verification/scripts/fleet_upgrade_report.py --target-version <version> \\
  --output /opt/data/scratch/fleet_versions.json
```

Without `--target-version` it measures each cluster against its own release channel's default and
prints that baseline per member. Run again during a rollout, it says which members started,
completed or stalled since the previous run. Without `--readiness` (below) it reads with
`gcloud container` only and changes nothing in GCP; the only thing it then writes is its own
record of each run under `/opt/data/state/fleet-upgrade-verification/`. The plan, runbook and
checklist for the members it flags are this skill's job.

The same script's `--readiness` flag executes three items of this skill's pre-upgrade checklist
per member, against the same target: PodDisruptionBudgets that would block a node drain
(`maxUnavailable: 0`, or `minAvailable` demanding every expected pod), maintenance exclusions and
the maintenance window at a given instant (`--at`, default now), and node-pool version skew
against the target control plane. It then runs the per-entry rules the fleet-upgrade-verification
skill lists for the upgrade-failure catalogue, each a blocker or a risk the report lists under
`risks` (a zonal control plane is one). Run it before writing the plan; carry its `blocked` rows and
`other blockers` into the checklist rather than asking the operator to check those items by hand,
and its risks as what to watch. The cluster reads cost one `get-credentials` and four `kubectl get`
per member and leave a per-member kubeconfig under `${{HERMES_HOME:-/opt/data}}/.kubeconfigs/`; an
exclusion is reported as holding back automatic upgrades only.

When the checklist's deprecated-API item comes up, the same skill's `api_deprecation_scan.py` scans
the linked GitOps repositories' manifests for apiVersions the target removes and reports each with
its replacement and the commit it read; run it with `--target-version` and the version report's
`--output`. It reads Git only: point at GKE Deprecation Insights for live client usage.

## Application-layer secrets encryption and Security Posture

The description and the gke-basics and gke-workload-security routing notes send these two flags
here.

**Secrets encryption (`--database-encryption-key`)** envelope-encrypts Secrets in etcd with a
Cloud KMS key. The key must be in the cluster's region (`KMS_LOCATION`; for a zonal cluster, the
region that contains its zone, since Cloud KMS has no zonal locations), and the GKE service agent
of the cluster's project (`CLUSTER_PROJECT_NUMBER`, not the key project's number) needs
`roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter` on it before the cluster can use it:

```bash
gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding KEY_NAME \\
  --keyring KEYRING_NAME --location KMS_LOCATION --project KMS_PROJECT_ID \\
  --member serviceAccount:service-CLUSTER_PROJECT_NUMBER@container-engine-robot.iam.gserviceaccount.com \\
  --role roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter

gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME --location LOCATION \\
  --database-encryption-key projects/KMS_PROJECT_ID/locations/KMS_LOCATION/keyRings/KEYRING_NAME/cryptoKeys/KEY_NAME

# CURRENT_STATE_ENCRYPTED once encryption completes (`state` is the requested setting, not the observed one)
gcloud container clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME --location LOCATION \\
  --format="value(databaseEncryption.currentState)"
```

**Security Posture (`--security-posture`)** turns on configuration auditing (`standard`) and,
with `--workload-vulnerability-scanning`, OS vulnerability scanning of running workloads:

```bash
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME --location LOCATION \\
  --security-posture=standard --workload-vulnerability-scanning=standard
```

## Reads this install withholds

The Platform Agent's command gate refuses three reads this skill uses:
`gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy` (Step 3), `gcloud asset search-all-iam-policies`
(Step 4) and `kubectl exec` (Step 5). Do not retry them in another spelling. Run the steps you can,
then hand the refused commands to the user with the placeholders filled in, say which output
decides the diagnosis, and ask for the result. A role granted on the whole project is readable
here: `gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID --format=json` shows it, so search its bindings
for the principal before handing Step 4 over.

Before recommending a start time, zone, or capacity path for a GPU/TPU or large-shape batch job —
