# Development Scripts

Local iteration tooling for this repository: rebuilding and redeploying agent images,
setting up Workload Identity Federation for CI, and tearing down the dev Artifact
Registry. These sat under `k8s-operator/scripts/dev/` until they moved here — they are
repository tooling rather than operator code, and the shared helpers they source now
live in the sibling [`../installer/`](../installer/README.md).

| Script                                     | What it does                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev_rebuild_agent.sh`                     | Rebuilds one agent image and redeploys it; what `make dev-rebuild-agent` runs           |
| `setup-gcp-github-wif.sh`                  | Workload Identity Federation for CI, documented below                                   |
| `teardown_dev_01_gcp_artifact_registry.sh` | Deletes the throwaway dev Artifact Registry this tooling created                        |
| `update_cluster_name.sh`                   | Patches the target GKE cluster name into the deployed `PlatformAgent` spec; run by hand |

`teardown_dev_01_gcp_artifact_registry.sh` asks before it deletes anything. `--no-confirm` (or
`-y`) answers yes for an unattended run and `--dry-run` shows the delete without making it; a
`CI=true` inherited from the environment is not a bypass.

## `setup-gcp-github-wif.sh`

### Purpose

The `setup-gcp-github-wif.sh` script automates the creation and configuration of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Workload Identity Federation (WIF). It sets up secure, keyless authentication so that your GitHub Actions pipelines can deploy and manage resources in your GCP project (like pushing Docker images and deploying to GKE) without requiring long-lived service account keys.

### What it does

1. **Enables Required APIs**: Ensures fundamental APIs (`iamcredentials`, `cloudresourcemanager`, `container`, `storage`, `pubsub`, `gkebackup`, `logging`, `artifactregistry`) are enabled on your GCP project.
2. **Creates a Service Account**: Provisions a dedicated GCP Service Account for GitHub Actions to impersonate.
3. **Assigns IAM Roles**: Grants necessary permissions (`roles/cloudkms.admin`, `roles/container.admin`, `roles/compute.viewer`, etc.) to the new service account. When run with `--admin`, grants extended lifecycle administration roles (`roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin`, `roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin`, `roles/pubsub.admin`, `roles/gkebackup.admin`, `roles/storage.admin`, `roles/logging.configWriter`, `roles/artifactregistry.admin`) required for full install/uninstall cycles (`install.sh` / `uninstall.sh`) and automated E2E testing.
4. **Configures WIF**: Creates a Workload Identity Pool and an OIDC Provider linked to GitHub (`https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`).
5. **Secures Access**: Configures attribute mapping and conditions so that _only_ your specific GitHub Repository is authorized to authenticate via this pool.
6. **Grants WIF Principal Role**: Grants the `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer` role to the WIF principal to allow it to consume service quota.
7. **Outputs Variables**: Generates the exact variables you need to configure in GitHub.

### Usage

Before running the script, you must have the Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`) installed and authenticated. You must also set three required environment variables:

- `PROJECT_ID`: Your target Google Cloud Project ID.
- `SA_NAME`: The desired name for the new Service Account (e.g., `github-actions-deploy-sa`).
- `GITHUB_REPO`: Your GitHub repository in `owner/repo` format (must be exact to allow access).

#### Options

- `--admin`: Grants extended IAM roles (`roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin`, `roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin`, `roles/pubsub.admin`, `roles/gkebackup.admin`, `roles/storage.admin`, `roles/logging.configWriter`, `roles/artifactregistry.admin`) for full autonomous install/uninstall lifecycle and E2E test operations.
- `ADMIN=true`: Environment variable alternative to `--admin`.

> **Note:** IAM role grants made with `--admin` are additive and remain assigned to the service account in your GCP project until manually revoked.

#### Example Execution

```bash
export PROJECT_ID="my-gcp-project-id"
export SA_NAME="github-actions-sa"
export GITHUB_REPO="your-github-username/your-repo-name"

cd scripts/dev/
chmod +x setup-gcp-github-wif.sh

# Standard roles for CI deployment
./setup-gcp-github-wif.sh

# Or with full lifecycle admin roles for autonomous provision/teardown cycles:
./setup-gcp-github-wif.sh --admin
```

When the script finishes, it will print three variables (`GCP_PROJECT_ID`, `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`, and `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER`). To complete the setup, copy those three values and add them to your GitHub Repository > Settings > Environments as Environment Variables.
