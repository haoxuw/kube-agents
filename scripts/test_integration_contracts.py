"""Cross-file contract lints: joins that nothing in any language checks.

Contracts that each fail silently today when the two sides drift:

* A verification spec naming a tool that no registry defines can never trip —
  the silent-green shape review found on the first gate branch (a safeguard
  forbidding a tool that did not exist).
* The bash and python DNS-endpoint predicates are a documented "keep in step"
  pair maintained by hand in two languages; a divergence strands whichever
  caller uses the stale one on the wrong control-plane endpoint.
* Workflows are joined to each other by display-name strings (`workflow_run:
  workflows: [...]`) and artifact-name strings; renaming a workflow silently
  disables every consumer, which for the autopush chain means continuous
  deployment stops without a red anywhere.
* The broken-main notifier watches a fixed roster of push-to-main workflows;
  a required check dropped from that roster goes red on main without anyone
  being told, which is how a thirteen-hour red main went unnoticed (#1223).
* The flaky-check notifier's roster is the inverse: every pull-request check
  is either watched or named as excluded with a reason; a new check that is
  neither has its re-runs recorded nowhere, and nothing says so.
