"""Classify one smoke-test run: which of its failures are the gate's and
which are the pull request's.

The gate comment on a pull request, the dashboard's PR view
(``run.html?build=<id>``) and the incident brief all answer the same
question about a red run -- "is this mine?" -- and they must answer it the
same way, so the rules live here once. ``classify_run`` is the whole
interface::

    classify_run(run, runs, health_at=None, now=None, admitted=None) -> {
        "build": str, "pr": int|None, "headline": str, "lede": str,
        "verdict": "red" | "green" | "infra",
        "cases": [{"case", "outcome", "cls", "also_failing_prs",
                   "pass_rate_30d", "reason", "excerpt", "do",
                   "admitted", "reps"}],
        "matches_incident": bool,
        # run-level detail: "setup_death", "storm_reps", "cls", "do"
    }

The first line of keys is the contract other callers rely on; the rest is
additive detail the pages show.

``run`` and ``runs`` are data.json shapes (SCHEMA.md); ``health_at`` is the
health.json document in force when the run finished (state, condition,
failing_cases are read; anything else is ignored); ``now`` anchors the
30-day pass rate and defaults to the run's finish. Every rule below is a
module constant with the incident it was tuned on; the vocabulary
(``shared_break`` / ``storm`` / ``setup_deaths``, storm-classified
repetitions, collapsed cases) is the CI health adjudicator's, restated here
so this module has no dependency beyond the standard library.

Per failed admitted case, in priority order:

* ``shared`` -- the same case failed every graded repetition on runs of at
  least SHARED_MIN_OTHER_PRS other pull requests that finished inside
  [start - SHARED_WINDOW_BEFORE, finish], or the health verdict names it.
  The 2026-09-07/08 crashloop outage (#1269, #1278) is the shape.
* ``storm`` -- the run lost at least STORM_RUN_SIGNATURE_REPS repetitions
  to 429s or empty records, or the verdict says storm (#1225, #1214).
* ``only-this-pr`` -- the case passed on the last ONLY_PR_MIN_OTHER_RUNS
  runs of other pull requests inside ONLY_PR_WINDOW and failed here.
* ``None`` -- nothing above fits; the page says it cannot tell.

``setup`` is a run-level class: no tasks, a FAILURE verdict, under
SETUP_DEATH_MAX_DURATION (#1172). Such a run has no cases to classify.

Only stdlib.
