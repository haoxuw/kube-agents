# Eval dashboard contracts: `data.json`, `brief.json`, the pages

`collect.py` writes `data.json`; the renderer and the publisher read it. It is a contract: field names, types and
derivation rules below are fixed. Changes must be additive optional fields
only — anything that renames, removes or re-types a field bumps
`schema_version` and lands together with both consumers.

## Derivation rules

### `runs[]` — one entry per finished Prow build, oldest first

Parsed from `build-log.txt` plus Prow's `started.json`/`finished.json`.
A build with no `finished.json` is still running and is skipped entirely.

- `build_id` — the Prow build directory name, as a **string** (the ids
  overflow 53-bit JSON-consumer integers).
- `pr` — `started.json`'s `pull`, falling back to the number in the GCS
  path. `null` when neither is available.
- `head_sha` — first 7 chars of `finished.json`'s `revision`; `null` when
  absent.
- `project` — from the `Successfully leased project: <name>` log line;
  `null` when the log never got that far.
- `started` / `finished` — `started.json` / `finished.json` timestamps as
  ISO 8601 UTC; `null` when unparseable.
- `result` — `finished.json`'s `result` verbatim: `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE` or
  `ABORTED`. This is the Prow job verdict, not the eval verdict.
- `duration_s` — the `Total Duration` of the final
  `PR Smoke Test Evaluation Succeeded/Failed` line (eval loop only). A
  truncated log has no verdict line — and neither does a `SUCCESS` build that
  `hack/ci-eval-pr.sh`'s step-0 revalidation ended before the eval loop; then
  it falls back to `finished − started` (which also counts provisioning).
- `tasks[]` — one entry per `Task <name> Result:` line, in log order (a
  verdict outside the vocabulary below — only the currently-unreachable
  `[EXPECTED_FAIL]`, which no `task.yaml` sets — does not parse and yields
  no entry):
  - `result` — `pass` for `[PASSED]`, `fail` for `[FAILED]` **and**
    `[UNSTABLE]` (a multi-repetition case that passed some but not all
    graded repetitions is not a clean pass; `reps` carries the split),
    `infra` for `[RESOURCE_PREPARATION_FAILED]` (resource prep, teardown or
    agent transport failed **before grading**; the case was skipped, not
    failed).
  - `duration_s` — from `(Duration: <n>s)`; `null` if missing (always the
    case for multi-repetition logs, whose verdict lines carry no duration).
  - `outcome_validity` — from `OutcomeValidity recorded: <x>`; `null` when
    none was recorded (always the case for `infra`, and for
    multi-repetition logs).
  - `reps` — **optional, additive**: per-repetition grading detail, one
    entry per indented `rep N: <verdict> -- <text>` grading line under the
    task's verdict line, in log order:
    `{"n": <1-based int>, "result": "pass"|"fail"|"infra", "reason": <string|null>}`.
    - `result` maps the grading verdict token: `pass` → `pass`; `infra` →
      `infra`, as is any **non-pass** rep whose line carries the literal
      `KUBE_AGENTS_INFRA_FAILURE` marker; anything else (`fail`, `blocked`,
      tokens this collector has never seen) → `fail`.
    - `reason` — the free text after the first space-padded `--` separator
      (later separators belong to the reason — fail reasons contain the
      delimiter themselves), with the trailing `[OutcomeScore=…]` metrics
      dump stripped, truncated to 300 chars. `null` for passing reps and
      when nothing remains.
    - **Omission semantics:** the key is absent — never `[]` — when the log
      has no `rep N:` grading lines for the task: single-repetition-era
      builds (branches predating the multi-repetition eval of 2026-08-28;
      presubmits run branch code, so no calendar date is sharp), logs
      truncated before grading, and foreign logs. Absence means _unknown_,
      and consumers must treat a missing `reps` exactly like a missing
      field, not an empty history. Serial
      (`--- [<ts>] <task> repetition N/3`) and parallel fan-out
      (`>>> [<ts>] launching <task> rep N/3`, merged 2026-08-31) runs print
      the same grading block, so both populate `reps` identically; launch
      markers alone carry no verdict and never fabricate entries.

- `pr_merged` — **optional, additive**: `true` when the run's `pr` had
  merged at collection time, `false` when it was open or closed unmerged,
  `null` when it could not be resolved (no `pr`, `gh` failed, or the run is
  outside the resolution window below). Absent when the collector ran
  without a `gh` binary configured; consumers must treat absent and `null`
  identically (unknown). Resolved best-effort with one
  `gh pr view <pr> --repo gke-labs/kube-agents --json state,mergedAt` per
  **distinct** PR per collect invocation, and **only for runs whose build
  started within the last 14 days** — the depth the dashboard displays —
  which is what bounds the `gh` spend of one collect however large the
  archive grows. An older run keeps whatever value it already carries, or
  gets `null` without a call. Merged is terminal: a run already carrying
  `true` is never re-asked at any age. Any failure degrades to `null` with
  a single warning naming how many PRs went unresolved, never a crash, and
  a missing binary or a timed-out call stops further calls for the rest of
  the pass.

A truncated log yields a **partial run** (fewer tasks, fallback duration),
never an error. A task line whose name matches nothing under `bench/tasks/`
on the current checkout still parses; only its domain lookup degrades (see
below).

### `cases[]` — one entry per task name seen in any run, sorted by name

- `domain` — the top-level `domain:` field of
  `bench/tasks/<name>/task.yaml` **on the checkout the collector runs
  from**; `"unknown"` for a historical task with no yaml (renamed or
  deleted). Never a crash.
- `active` — `true` iff the name is an **uncommented** entry in
  `hack/ci-eval-pr.sh`'s `TASKS` array (same textual parse as
  `scripts/test_domain_coverage.py`). Historical-only cases are kept with
  `active: false`.
- `runs_on_record` — total task appearances across all runs, `infra`
  included (it is history).
- `pass_rate` — `passes / (passes + fails)`. **`infra` results are excluded
  from the denominator** — an infrastructure failure never counts against a
  case. `null` when every run on record was `infra` (nothing graded to
  rate).
- `last3` — the last ≤3 results, **newest last**, `infra` included.
- `durations` — min/median/max of `duration_s` over **graded** (non-infra)
  runs; all three `null` when there are none. Median is rounded to an int.
- `ov_history` — `{build_id, value}` per run that recorded an
  OutcomeValidity, oldest first.
- **Known gap:** multi-repetition verdict lines carry no task-level
  duration or OutcomeValidity, so `durations` and `ov_history` accrue only
  from single-repetition-era runs and freeze once those age out of the
  window. Collecting per-rep durations from the per-rep finish markers
  (`<<< finished <task> rep N in Ss`) is a follow-up; renderers should not
  present these two as current for repetition-era data.

### Optional top-level fields

Additive, optional, and safe to omit — consumers must default them.

- `stale_after_s` — seconds after `generated_at` beyond which the rendered
  page labels itself `STALE`. Emitted only when the collector is invoked
  with `--stale-after-s` (the hourly refresh job passes its cadence plus
  slack); the renderer defaults to `7200` when it is absent.
- `pending_builds` — builds the GCS scan listed but could not record: no
  readable `finished.json` yet (still running, or the upload failed), so
  they are not in `runs[]` and do not raise the watermark. Entries are
  `{"build_id": "<id>", "first_seen": "<iso8601>"}`, lowest id first;
  `first_seen` is when the collector first listed the build. The next
  incremental scan re-reads exactly these ids even though they sit at or
  below the watermark, and drops an entry once it is recorded or once
  `first_seen` is more than 2 days old (`PENDING_RETRY_DAYS` — a build
  unfinished that long is a pod that died without uploading). Omitted when
  empty; a malformed value is ignored with a warning, never a crash.

### Optional run and task fields

Additive, optional, and safe to omit — consumers must default them. The
collector's derivation rules for both live under `runs[]` above; this is
what the renderer does with them.

- `runs[].pr_merged` — `true` | `false` | `null`: whether the run's PR has
  merged. The renderer's "agent" band charts only runs where it is `true`
  (the final such run per PR); absent or `null` keeps a run out of that
  cohort without any other effect.
- `runs[].tasks[].reps` — the task's individual repetitions, in order:
  `[{"n": 1, "result": "pass"|"fail"|"infra", "reason": "<string>"|null}]`.
  `reason` is free-form log text (renderers must escape it). `infra` reps
  are excluded from every pass-fraction denominator, exactly like `infra`
  task results. When `reps` is absent the task's single `result` stands in
  for one rep.

### `coverage` — from `docs/designs/domains.yaml`

- `domains_total` — number of entries under `domains:`.
- `uncovered` — the `allowlist` entries (the domains known-uncovered
  today).
- `domains_covered` — `domains_total − len(uncovered)`.

## Sources

- `--pr-glob <gs glob>` (repeatable) — Prow build dirs, discovered with
  `gsutil ls`, read with `gsutil cat`. **Read-only.**
- `--from-dir <dir>` — local `<build_id>/` subdirectories with the same
  three files; the offline/testing path.

### Incremental collection (the output stays schema v1; it may add the optional `pending_builds`)

- `--merge-with <data.json | gs:// URL>` — load a previously written
  data.json, carry its `runs[]` over (verbatim except `pr_merged`, which
  is re-resolved on carried runs by the same rules as on fresh ones — a
  `false`/`null` inside the 14-day window is re-asked, `true` is
  terminal), and skip every GCS build whose id is ≤ the newest
  **numeric** `build_id` on record — except the
  ids on the prior's `pending_builds`, which are re-read regardless. Prow
  build ids increase monotonically **by start time**, not by finish time,
  so the watermark alone would permanently skip a build that was still in
  flight when a later, shorter build got recorded; `pending_builds` (see
  Optional top-level fields) is how those builds get back in. Overlapping
  builds dedupe by `build_id` with the **freshly parsed** copy winning;
  `cases[]` and `coverage` are recomputed from the merged run list on the
  current checkout. A missing, unreadable, truncated, non-v1 or
  implausible prior file is a **warning that degrades to a fresh sweep
  bounded to `--since-days 14`** — never a crash (the first armed run has
  no prior file at all). This is what lets an hourly periodic republish in
  minutes instead of re-reading ~3 objects per archived build.
- `--since-days <n>` — skip GCS builds whose `started.json` timestamp is
  older than `n` days. Costs one probe read per candidate build and saves
  the other two; builds with an unreadable `started.json` are kept (the
  no-`finished.json` rule still skips them). `--from-dir` sources are
  never filtered.
- `--stale-after-s <seconds>` — write `stale_after_s` (see Optional
  top-level fields) into the output. Omitted, the field is omitted and the
  renderer's default applies.

## The rendered pages

`render.py` writes three pages beside `data.json`. Every time shown on the
first two is America/Toronto ("ET"), formatted in the browser with
`Intl.DateTimeFormat`; URL parameters stay ISO 8601 UTC.

| Page          | What it is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `index.html`  | **The Brief**: the gate's state and why, what the agent saw, what changed right before, what is being done, and the runs in the window. Healthy: the last 24 hours in numbers and the last incident.                                                               |
| `run.html`    | **The PR view**, `run.html?build=<prow build id>`: one run, each failed gate case tagged `failing on N other PRs` / `only your PR` / `quota storm` / `unexplained` with its check reason, 30-day pass rate, transcript link and a one-line Do; a "what to do" box. |
| `legacy.html` | The two-band page (agent trend, gate matrix, Pareto, evidence table).                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The Brief and the PR view render in the browser from `brief.json` (below)
and refetch it and `health.json` every 60 seconds. `classify.py` is the one
place the "is this red mine?" rule lives; the pages read its answer through
`brief.json`, and anything else that answers the question imports it.

### URL contract

`index.html?cases=a,b&since=<ISO 8601 UTC>&until=<ISO 8601 UTC>#gate|#agent`

- `cases`, `since`, `until` scope the Brief to that incident (a past one
  when `until` is given). `since` is matched to an incident in
  `health-history.jsonl`; without history the parameters describe it.
- `#agent` shows the last 24 hours in numbers; `#gate` lands on the
  "why we think" block. No parameters: the current state from `health.json`.
- Case ids match `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,79}`; the first 50
  (`maxLinkCases`) that do are read, and a link the pages write carries at
  most those 50. A value that fails its grammar is dropped and everything
  reaches the DOM escaped.
- `since` and `until` are read with a `Z`, a space separator, or a UTC
  offset written `+02:00` or `+0200`, and converted; the pages themselves
  write `Z`.
- `run.html?build=<digits>`; an id not in `brief.json` shows a
  not-found page naming the window (`RUN_VIEW_DAYS`, 14 days).

### `brief.json` (written by `render.py`)

`{schema_version, generated_at, stale_after_s, run_days, admitted[],
health, history, merges, cases{}, runs[]}`. `runs[]` is the last
`run_days` of `data.json`, oldest first, each carrying its identity and
timing plus `classify.classify_run(...)`: `verdict` (`red` = looks like
the PR, `green`, `infra` = the gate's), `headline`, `lede`,
`matches_incident`, `setup_death`, `storm_reps`, `do`, `cases[]`
(`{case, outcome, cls, also_failing_prs, pass_rate_30d, reason, excerpt,
do, admitted, reps}`) and `health_at` (the verdict in force when it
finished, from history; `null` without history). `health` is the current
verdict, `history` the ticks and the incidents derived from them, `merges`
the recent first-parent commits of the checkout (`null` when the checkout
is shallow or has no git, and the page omits "what changed right before").

### `health.json` and `health-history.jsonl` (optional inputs)

`health.json` is the CI health adjudicator's verdict, published beside
`data.json` (nothing in this directory writes it); the fields read are
`state` (`GREEN|DEGRADED|OUTAGE`), `condition`
(`shared_break|storm|setup_deaths`), `since`, `cause`, `advice`,
`failing_cases`, `tracking_issues`, `incident`, `recovering`, `stale`,
`generated_at`, `tick`. Any other state, or an unreadable file, means no
verdict: the Brief says no verdict is published and shows the last 24
hours in numbers and the runs, the PR view classifies from the runs alone
and shows no gate banner. Only a `GREEN` verdict reads as healthy.

`health-history.jsonl` is one JSON object per line, each the full
`health.json` document as published at that tick plus
`"tick": "<ISO 8601 UTC>"`, oldest first (the reader sorts anyway and
skips a malformed line). A run of non-GREEN ticks is one incident, from
its first tick's `since` to the first GREEN tick after it; that is what
the Brief's past-incident view and the PR view's "gate state at the time"
banner read. Absent, the pages show the current verdict only. Neither
file is copied into the out-dir: the adjudicator owns both.

## Fixtures

`testdata/` holds three **real** `pull-kube-agents-smoke-test` builds
(PRs 956 and 998), logs trimmed to the eval section, `started.json` /
`finished.json` verbatim:

| build               | why it is here                                       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 2092688354838581248 | PR 956 — deadline truncated the log, no verdict line |
| 2093030474753511424 | PR 998 — `RESOURCE_PREPARATION_FAILED` (infra) task  |
| 2093054394793725952 | PR 998 — full run, pass/fail mix, verdict line       |

These three predate the multi-repetition eval, which is exactly why they
stay: they pin the omission semantics of `reps` (no grading lines, no key).
`testdata_reps/` holds three more **real** builds from the repetition era,
same trimming, covering both launch-marker formats and every rep verdict
token observed in the wild (`pass`, `fail`, `infra`, `blocked`):

| build               | why it is here                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 2094432646640701440 | PR 1057 — parallel fan-out, green, one infra rep |
| 2094467976156680192 | PR 1075 — serial markers, aborted mid-task       |
| 2094714569262895104 | PR 1089 — blocked/infra-heavy, >300-char reasons |

`testdata_health/data.json.gz` is a **real** published `data.json` reduced by
`health.py --trim` (and gzip-compressed, which `health.py --data` reads by
suffix) to the runs that finished in [2026-09-01, 2026-09-09) — the last of
them on 2026-09-08 — and the fields the health adjudicator reads (`build_id`,
`pr`, `started`, `finished`, `result`, `duration_s`, and per task `name`,
`result`, `reps[].result` and the first 96 characters of `reps[].reason`);
its `trimmed` key records the source and the cut. Six of its zero-task runs
carry `result: "failure"` in lowercase, as Prow wrote them on 2026-09-05 —
the one departure from the `result` vocabulary above seen in the wild, so
consumers compare it case-insensitively. `testdata_health/roster-history.json` is the
`BOOTSTRAP_ADMITTED` roster per era over the same week, taken from the
commits that changed it. Together they are the replay fixture
`scripts/test_eval_dashboard_health.py` asserts the week's incident
timeline against.

`testdata_classify/incidents.json.gz` holds a published `data.json`'s runs
for two windows of the week of 2026-09-01 (PR #913's last runs on 09-04/05;
the crashloop outage of 09-07/08 with PR #608's 15-case red inside it),
trimmed to the fields `classify.py` reads, for `test_eval_dashboard_classify.py`
and the page tests.
