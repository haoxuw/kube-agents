"""Render the eval dashboard from the collector's data.json.

Usage::

    python3 scripts/eval_dashboard/render.py --data data.json --out-dir out/ \\
        [--health health.json] [--health-history health-history.jsonl]

writes three pages and two data files into ``out/``:

* ``index.html`` -- **the Brief**: what state the smoke gate is in, why the
  bot thinks so, what the agent saw, what changed right before, what is
  being done, and the runs in the window. Scoped by
  ``?cases=a,b&since=<ISO>&until=<ISO>`` to a past incident; ``#agent``
  shows the last 24 hours in numbers.
* ``run.html?build=<prow build id>`` -- **the PR view**: one run, its
  failed cases each tagged as the gate's or the pull request's
  (``classify.py``), and what to do.
* ``legacy.html`` -- the two-band page below: the matrix, the Pareto, the
  evidence table.
* ``brief.json`` -- what the two new pages render from: the per-run
  classification, the current health verdict, the incident history and the
  recent merges. ``data.json`` is copied verbatim beside it.

The Brief and the PR view are rendered in the browser from ``brief.json``
(``template/page.html.tmpl`` + ``template/pages.js``); every time they show
is America/Toronto, formatted there. The optional inputs are
``health.json`` (the CI health adjudicator's verdict, published beside
data.json; nothing here writes it) and ``health-history.jsonl`` (one
health.json document per line plus a ``tick`` stamp); without them the
Brief says no verdict is published and both pages show what the runs
alone support, never an error.

The legacy page tells one story in two bands:

* **THE AGENT** -- is the agent getting better or worse, measured on the
  merged-PR cohort (the final ``pr_merged`` run of each PR): weekly pass
  rate, human-annotated catches, domain coverage, and a by-day pass-fraction
  trend with named event markers.
* **THE GATE** -- is the gate trustworthy: false-red and infra-rep tiles, a
  case x run outcome matrix over the last runs, and a Pareto of normalized
  failure signatures.

Three rules shape everything here:

* **Computed-only.** Every figure on the legacy page is derived from
  data.json -- no hand-typed numbers can go stale in a template. Its two
  optional extra inputs are ``case-notes.yaml`` (``--notes``: one-line annotations, issue
  links and badges per case) and ``events.yaml`` (``--events``: dated event
  markers plus the few human-judgment counts no log line carries). An absent
  file degrades to "no annotation" -- never an error.
* **INFRA is not failure.** A rep (or task) whose result is ``infra`` is
  excluded from every pass-fraction denominator, matching the suite's policy
  that infrastructure failures never count against a PR.
* **Run-level events are charged to the run, not the cases.** A run where at
  least ``RUN_EVENT_FAIL_FRACTION`` of its graded tasks failed (a broken PR,
  an endpoint outage) renders normally in the matrix but its failures are
  excluded from per-case aggregates such as the failure-signature Pareto.
  The exclusion is deliberately scoped to per-case aggregates: band 1's
  cohort is the final run of each *merged* PR, and a merged PR's own
  failures are that cohort's signal, not noise to exclude.

The reader contract is schema_version 1 of the collector's data.json.
Optional fields may be absent and unknown additive fields are ignored, so
this renderer and the collector can ship independently. In particular
``tasks[].reps`` and ``runs[].pr_merged`` are optional additive fields
(SCHEMA.md, "Optional run and task fields"); without them every task falls
back to its single ``result`` and the merged-PR cohort is simply empty.

The legacy page is also live: render.py bakes the data, notes and events
into the template, whose script re-renders in place from a fresh
``data.json`` fetch every 60 seconds and keeps a freshness badge honest (see
the template's "Live read side" comment). The Python fragment builders here
and the JS mirrors there are intentionally parallel -- change them together.

Only stdlib + PyYAML (already in requirements-test.txt) -- no build step.
