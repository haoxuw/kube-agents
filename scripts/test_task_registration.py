"""Every bench case is valid, and either in the presubmit's TASKS array or excluded.

`hack/ci-eval-pr.sh` runs the tasks listed in its TASKS array, and only those:
tasks under bench/tasks/ are not picked up automatically, the script's own
comment says so, and nothing owned the difference between "left out on
purpose" and "nobody remembered". That is how agent-kanban-smoke -- a task
whose whole point is to smoke the deployed pipeline -- sat registered nowhere
while the presubmit ran one task for months. A task nobody registered is the
same failure as a domain nobody covered.

This test owns that difference, and four more like it. The rules and the
allowlists live in scripts/validate_bench_cases.py, which `make
bench-case-check` also runs. Sharing the implementation is only half of what
it takes for the two to agree: this lint also has to assert on everything that
module returns rather than on a hand-listed set of substrings, which is what
TestEveryTaskIsValid's whole-set assertion is for -- see its docstring for the
rules that leaked through before it existed. `make bench-case-check` is
invoked by no workflow; this lint, reached through PYTHON_TEST_DIRS in the
Makefile and run by .github/workflows/python-tests.yml, is the whole of the
enforcement on a pull request. A case passes by being named in
TASKS (a commented-out entry counts: it is registered, pending activation,
which is how scenarios wait for the seeded fleet), by an entry in
NIGHTLY_TASKS (the nightly tier, which EVAL_TIER=nightly appends to TASKS --
the runner this docstring once said did not exist), or by a reviewed entry in
the validator's KNOWN_UNREGISTERED with the reason.

This lint and scripts/test_domain_coverage.py ratchet together. That one
counts a domain covered only when a task carrying its slug and a non-empty
verification_spec has an ACTIVE, uncommented TASKS entry, so a
registered-but-dormant task never counts as coverage; this one guarantees
every task is at least registered and internally valid.

TASKS is read from the script's text rather than by executing it: the script
provisions clusters and reads secrets, so running it to ask a question is not
an option. The parse is deliberately narrow -- the TASKS=( ... ) block only --
and a parse that finds nothing fails loudly rather than passing vacuously.

    Two layers, and they do different jobs.

    assertions under it are the diagnosis: each matches one substring, so a

    The per-rule layer was the whole gate for one commit, and it leaked. Every
    assertion here matches a fixed substring of a problem string, so a problem
    matching none of them was collected into cls.results and never asserted
    on: `does not parse to a mapping`, `declares no 'id:'`, `duplicate entry
