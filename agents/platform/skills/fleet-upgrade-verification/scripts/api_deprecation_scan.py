"""
api_deprecation_scan.py — Kubernetes API removals between the fleet and a target version,
read from the manifests the linked GitOps repositories declare.

An upgrade to a version that removes an API breaks every workload still declaring it.
This script reads what Git declares before the target is chosen: every `*.yaml`, `*.yml`
and `*.json` in each managed repository, the top-level `apiVersion`/`kind`/`metadata.name`
of every document in it, matched against `removed_apis.json` beside this file. A hit is an
apiVersion removed after the fleet's current version and no later than the target.

The fleet's current version comes from Phase 1's table (`fleet_upgrade_report.py --output`)
or from `--current-version`; the floor is the lowest control-plane minor, because the API
server is what stops serving a removed version — node pools do not enter into it.

Read-only against every repository. It opens each one through the credential broker's
content workspaces (a shallow read-only clone the broker owns) and, on an install whose
broker is not armed for content-passing, through a leased checkout on the shared volume,
the way `inspect_repository.py clone` does — under a lease of its own, so the reset that
positions that checkout on the base branch never touches the session's working tree, the
one `submit_suggestion.py prepare` hands the agent to edit. It runs no `gcloud`. Live client usage of deprecated
APIs is a different question, answered by GKE Deprecation Insights; the footer says where.

A file that does not parse (a Helm template, a Kustomize patch with anchors the loader
refuses) is listed as skipped with the reason, never a crash, and a section reads clean
only alongside the count of what it did not read. A repository the broker or git cannot
serve is listed under errors and sets exit code 1: no repo, no false clean.
