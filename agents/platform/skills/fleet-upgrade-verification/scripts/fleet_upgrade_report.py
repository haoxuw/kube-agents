fleet_upgrade_report.py — per-member GKE version table against a target version.

Enumerates every cluster in the target projects with `gcloud container clusters list`,
reads each control-plane and node-pool version, and compares them with a target: the
`--target-version` given on the command line, or, without one, each cluster's own
release-channel `defaultVersion` from `gcloud container get-server-config`. Prints a
Markdown table on stdout and, with `--output`, writes the same data as JSON.

Each run also records its per-member result under a state directory, keyed by target,
and reads the previous run's record for the same target: a "Rollout progress" section
after the table says per member whether it `started`, `completed`, or is `unchanged`
since that run, and flags an unchanged, behind member as `stalled` while a rollout is
active (another member moved, or `--rollout-in-progress` was passed).

With `--readiness`, each member is also graded on whether it can take the upgrade to its
target: drain-blocking PodDisruptionBudgets (read with one `kubectl get` per member after
`gcloud container clusters get-credentials` into a per-target kubeconfig), a maintenance
exclusion in effect whose scope covers the upgrade, the maintenance window's state at
`--at`, node-pool version skew against the target control plane, and the workload rules
that read the pod templates for the upgrade-failure catalogue's node-image entries, from
three more reads per member after the first (DaemonSets, CronJobs and claims; StorageClasses;
the Nodes projected to the fields the rules use). The rules live in `upgrade_readiness.py`
and its `readiness_rules/` package; this file reads and renders.

Read-only against GCP: the gcloud commands it runs are `container clusters list`,
`container get-server-config`, `projects list`, `config get-value project`, `projects
describe` (to tie an API-disabled refusal to its project or resolve a numeric project
number to its projectId) and, with
`--readiness`, `container clusters get-credentials`. The only things it writes are its
own state file, the per-target kubeconfig files `get-credentials` produces, and the
optional `--output` JSON.
