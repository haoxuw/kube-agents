deprecated_api_callers.py — catalogue entry 9: a client writes through an API that is
deprecated and still served.

The API server stamps every request for a deprecated API version with the audit
annotation `k8s.io/deprecated=true`, a Cloud Logging entry label; an API with a removal
scheduled also carries `k8s.io/removed-release`, and those callers are the removed-API
rule's. This rule reads the shared deprecated-or-kubectl read (paged `gcloud logging
read`, the seven days ending at the evaluation instant, the provider's principals excluded
in the filter) and files each operator caller of a deprecated API as a risk, named with its
principal, user agent and API, with the successor where the tables name one: nothing
breaks on upgrade day, and the count is what a later removal turns into an outage. A
principal the rule cannot place is a risk naming it. The provider's callers that the filter
did not express (kube-system's endpoint-controller is stamped on every Service's Endpoints
it writes) are counted in the note, not filed.

The log carries writes only: a caller that only reads a deprecated API is not in it, and
GKE Deprecation Insights are the cross-check. A read that fails or times out is `unknown`
with the reason; a read that still filled its last page is graded on what it saw, with a note.
