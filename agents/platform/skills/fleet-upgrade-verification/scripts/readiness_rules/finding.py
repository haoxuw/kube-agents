"""
finding.py — the tiered-finding helpers the audit-log, client-skew and changed-defaults rules
share, on top of the result shape the package docstring fixes.

Not a rule. A rule's `evaluate` returns `empty_result()` filled in: three lists of findings,
one per tier, plus `notes`, the strings the report appends to the member's note column for
what the rule read but did not file (the provider's callers, namespaces pinned to a version,
a sampled read). Every finding carries `rule` and `tier`; an `unknown` finding carries
`reason`. `pod_spec` is the package's one pod-template walk, so a kind added for one rule is
read by every rule.
