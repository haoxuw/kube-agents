"""
Entry 11 of docs/designs/upgrade-failure-catalogue.md: the control plane is unreachable
for minutes on a zonal cluster.

A zonal cluster has one control-plane replica, and GKE replaces it during the upgrade,
so the Kubernetes API is unavailable for minutes; the nodes and their pods keep running.
The rule reads the cluster's `location`: a zone (`us-central1-a`) is a zonal control
plane, a region (`us-central1`) a regional one. A multi-zonal cluster, nodes in several
zones under one zonal control plane, reads as zonal, which it is. Whether the cluster's
API clients retry is not readable from the cluster, so the finding is a risk on every
report and never a block: the upgrade completes; what fails is a client that does not
retry.
