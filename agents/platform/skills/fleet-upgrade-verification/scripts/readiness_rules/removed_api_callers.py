"""
removed_api_callers.py — catalogue entry 6: a client still writes through an API version
the target minor no longer serves.

The API server stamps every request for a version it will stop serving with the audit
annotation `k8s.io/removed-release=<minor>`, which Cloud Logging keeps as an entry label.
The rule reads those entries through the shared removed-release read (paged
`gcloud logging read`, the seven days ending at the evaluation instant, the provider's
principals excluded) and grades each caller against the target. An operator caller of an
API removed at or before the target minor whose latest write is within the last 48 hours
blocks the upgrade, named with its principal, user agent, API and release, and with the
replacement where the GitOps scan's removal table names one; a caller silent for longer
is a risk naming its last write, because a migrated caller must not block for a week. A
removal after the target, a provider caller (GKE moves its own components), and a
principal the rule cannot place are risks, never blockers.

The log carries writes only: a caller that only reads a removed API is not in it, and GKE
Deprecation Insights are the cross-check. A read that fails or times out is `unknown` with
the reason; a read that still filled its last page is graded on what it saw, with a note.
