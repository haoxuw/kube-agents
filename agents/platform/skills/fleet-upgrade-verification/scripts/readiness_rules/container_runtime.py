"""
Entry 13 of docs/designs/upgrade-failure-catalogue.md: the container runtime changes.

Every supported GKE node runs containerd; what a node pool upgrade can change is the
containerd major the target's node image ships. A pod that talks to the runtime through
its socket, mounted from the host, is what that change breaks: a client pinned to the
`v1alpha2` CRI API, an agent reading the containerd 1.x configuration layout. The rule
pairs the two reads. The runtime side compares each pool's current containerd major,
read from its nodes' `status.nodeInfo.containerRuntimeVersion` (or, when the nodes were
not read, from the table by the pool's minor) with the major the target's node image
ships, from `upgrade_shape_tables.CONTAINERD_MAJOR_BY_GKE_MINOR` for the pool's image
family. The workload side is every pod or template mounting a runtime socket through a
`hostPath` volume. A pool whose major changes at the target with socket clients in the
cluster is a risk naming the pool, both majors and the clients' owners; a change with no
client, and clients with no change, are notes; a change on a cluster whose read failed is
unknown, since the clients could not be read.
