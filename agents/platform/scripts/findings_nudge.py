"""The morning nudge: a short chat message naming the top critical findings.

Backs the ``findings-morning-nudge`` cron job, which runs with ``no_agent:
true`` and ``deliver: "chat"``. Its stdout is delivered verbatim, so everything
this prints is what the user reads, and printing nothing relays nothing.

No model turn, because there is no judgement to make: the ordering is the
queue's (`GET /v1/findings/ranked`), the severity is computed by the rubric at
registration, and the recommendation was written by whoever found the thing.
What is left is counting and formatting.

This is §7.2 of `docs/designs/inventory-findings-queue.md` minus two things.
The design's nudge links to a backlog document holding the whole queue; that
publisher (§7.1) is not built, so the message says how many findings it did not
name rather than pointing at a list of them. And the design gates every message
on the list having changed, paired with a weekly message so a silent week
cannot be confused with a broken job. Here the gate applies only to a morning
that names no critical the last sweep still saw: such a critical is repeated
daily until it is fixed, which makes the weekly floor unnecessary for the case
that would cost something to lose.

One addition: this run also expires lapsed snoozes before reading the queue
(§3.2). This job is the queue's only daily tick, so nothing else would return
a snoozed row whose date has passed.
