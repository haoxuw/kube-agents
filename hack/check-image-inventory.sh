#
#   1. A pin drifts. The chart sat on LiteLLM v1.92.0 for a release while the
#      kustomize base it claimed to mirror was on v1.95.0. A mirror populated
#      from the inventory then lacks the tag the install asks for.
#   2. A new image appears with no inventory entry. Nothing copies it, and the
#      air-gapped install fails at pull time on a registry nobody approved.
#
# And one that has not happened yet: the Go builder pin matches the inventory
# but no longer satisfies k8s-operator/go.mod, so the image build fails, or a
# base without GOTOOLCHAIN=local builds with a toolchain nobody pinned.
#
# Run via `make images-check`; CI runs it in validate.yml.
