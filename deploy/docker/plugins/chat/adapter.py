"""``deliver: "chat"`` — hand a cron job's report to the Chat Agent.

Installed at ``/opt/hermes/plugins/platforms/chat/`` so Hermes discovers it as a
bundled platform plugin. Nothing in the Hermes tree is edited: the scheduler
already routes ``deliver=<name>`` through the platform registry, and
``cron/scheduler_delivery.py::_plugin_cron_env_var`` says so in its own words —
plugins that set ``cron_deliver_env_var`` on their ``PlatformEntry`` "get cron
delivery support without editing this module".

Why a delivery mode and not a prompt instruction
------------------------------------------------

The relay itself — the Chat Agent composing the message, and the report being
stored against the thread it lands in — is ``docs/designs/cron-report-relay.md``.
This module is only about *what triggers* it.

The first cut triggered it from the job's prompt: call ``report_to_chat``, then
return ``[SILENT]``. That works for a roster shipped in the image, where the
prompt is reviewed alongside the job, and fails for everything else. A job the
user asks for at runtime ("watch that rollout every ten minutes and tell me when
it settles") is created through ``cronjob(action='create')`` with whatever prompt
the moment produced, so it carries no such contract — and its ``deliver`` then
resolves to a Google Chat home channel this image cannot hand a child profile,
i.e. to nowhere. The result is a job that runs forever and is never heard from,
which is the exact failure the relay exists to end.

``deliver`` is the field that already means "where does the output go", every
creation path can set it, and ``create_job``'s fixed keyword signature makes it
the only field a runtime-created job *can* set. So the relay is a platform, and
asking for it is one field.

Why this platform is not a platform
-----------------------------------

It has no inbound side and no adapter. ``adapter_factory`` exists because
``PlatformEntry`` requires one and raises if the gateway ever tries to build it —
which it will not, because ``_is_connected`` returns False unless
``CHAT_HOME_CHANNEL`` is set, and only ``profile_cron_tick.py`` sets it, for the
cron children it spawns. In the gateway process the platform stays unregistered
in the config, invisible to ``gateway status``, and starts nothing.

That one variable is the whole switch: it gates enablement (through
``is_connected``), it is the ``cron_deliver_env_var`` the scheduler reads to
resolve ``deliver: "chat"`` to a target, and where it is unset the platform
behaves as if this directory were not there.

What the sender can and cannot see
----------------------------------

``standalone_sender_fn`` is handed the delivery text, not the job. The job's id
and name are in the text, because ``_deliver_result`` wraps every cron delivery
in a two-line header before sending it, and :func:`parse_cron_wrapper` reads them
back out. That coupling is checked at image build time by
``deploy/docker/plugins/verify_chat_relay.py``, which drives the real
``_deliver_result`` and asserts on what arrived — so upstream changing the
wrapper fails the build rather than degrading in production.

If the header is ever absent (``cron.wrap_response: false`` turns it off), the
report still relays: it just arrives under a per-profile session for the day
instead of a per-job one, and says so in the log.

    True for an empty report, and for one whose *entire* content is the silence
    marker however the model dressed it. ``` `[SILENT]` ``` and ``**[SILENT]**``
    are the forms to expect: these reports are written by agents that write
    markdown by default, and every audit SOP tells a quiet run to make the bare
    marker its entire final response. Emphasise it once and the run that meant
    to say nothing posts the word "[SILENT]" to the home channel instead, which
    is the one outcome the silent path exists to prevent. So undress the report
    before testing it. On a real report this changes nothing: stripping
    punctuation off the two ends of a multi-line audit summary cannot turn it
    into the marker.

    **Entire** is load-bearing, and it is why this does not call the scheduler's
    ``_is_cron_silence_response``. That matcher accepts the marker on its own
    line among prose, which is right for the thing it grades — a model's final
    response to a cron prompt, where the marker anywhere means the model chose
    silence and the prose is its reasoning. It is wrong for what reaches here.
    ``standalone_send`` is this platform's sender for every ``hermes send --to
    chat``, whichever process issues it: the scheduler's ``deliver: "chat"`` leg
    today, and any alert or tool that names the platform tomorrow. An alert that
    quotes the marker while explaining why a run published nothing — which is
    exactly what an alert about a silent run says — would match that matcher
    and be dropped with ``{"success": True, "skipped": "empty_text"}`` and no
    ``message_id``, so the caller could not tell it had lost the page.

    Delegating would buy nothing against that cost. Where the scheduler's
    matcher applies it suppresses delivery before this sender runs, so its extra
    leniency is redundant here; the only calls it would change are the ones it
    never graded. Everything the marker legitimately arrives as when it is the
    whole message — bare, lowercased, dressed, padded — the two lines below
    already catch.

    Bare ``strip()`` on both sides of the dress, because this predicate
    replaced a plain ``not report.strip()`` and has to stay a superset of it.
    ``_MARKDOWN_DRESS`` can only list ASCII characters, while ``str.strip()``
    also takes NBSP, ``\\x0b``, ``\\x0c``, ``\\x1c``, ``\\u2028``, ``\\u2003``
    and ``\\u3000`` — so stripping the dress alone called a report of one NBSP
    non-empty and relayed it. `submit_cron_report` then rejects it as blank
    with an HTTP 400 that lands in ``last_delivery_error``, which is the exact
    failure this guard exists to prevent. The trailing strip catches the same
