"""Wire tools/cron_run_scope.py into the Hermes source tree.

Run by ``deploy/docker/Dockerfile`` against ``/opt/hermes``. Two AST locators
and sixteen anchored string replacements across four files is past the point
where an inline ``python3 -c`` stays readable, so the edits live here — but the
guarantee is the same as the other patches in the Dockerfile: every anchor must
be found the number of times expected, every edited file must still parse, and
anything else fails the build loudly rather than shipping a half-patched image.

Why each edit is needed is documented in the module docstring of
``deploy/docker/patches/cron_run_scope.py``. Usage::

    python3 apply_cron_run_scope.py [HERMES_ROOT]   # default /opt/hermes

Anchors are derived against v2026.9.14. That release decomposed
``cron/scheduler.py`` (``_run_one_job_body`` now delegates its save/deliver
phase to ``_save_compose_deliver`` over a ``_RunDelivery`` record and its
bookkeeping tail to ``_finish_completed_run``), split ``tools/cronjob_tools.py``
into per-action helpers (``_action_run``, ``_action_create``) and rewrote the
kanban ownership helpers to raise ``_Reject`` instead of returning a
``tool_error``. The edit sites below follow those moves; the behaviour they
produce is unchanged.

# --- cron/scheduler.py: stop discarding the run's own report ----------------
#
# The out-param goes on the end of the keyword-only parameters of *both* halves
# of the run entry point. Located rather than spelled out: this used to be a
# literal anchor on the whole one-line signature, and v2026.8.13 both wrapped
# that line onto three and added an ``extra_prompt`` of its own, either of which
# broke the build for a change the patch has no opinion about. What it does have
# an opinion about is that this is still the shared execute→deliver→mark body
# the ticker and the cronjob tool both call, which is what expect_keyword_only
# asserts.
#
# Both halves, because v2026.8.19 split the function in two: ``run_one_job`` is
# now a wrapper that registers the fire owner and delegates, through
# ``_run_with_fire_claim_heartbeat``, to ``_run_one_job_body``, where the
# execute→deliver→mark sequence — and every write site below — actually lives.
# The parameter has to be on the wrapper because that is what callers name, on
# the body because that is what the writes read, and forwarded across the lambda
# in between. Putting it on the wrapper alone is not a build failure: both
# anchors still match, the file still parses, and the body raises ``name
# 'outcome' is not defined`` on the first real cron tick in a cluster.
