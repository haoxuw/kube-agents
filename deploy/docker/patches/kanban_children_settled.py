"""Refuse to close a card whose fanned-out children are still running.

Installed into the image at ``/opt/hermes/tools/kanban_children_settled.py``
and wired into ``tools/kanban_tools.py`` (the ``kanban_create`` and
``kanban_complete`` handlers) by
``deploy/docker/patches/apply_kanban_children_settled.py``.

Why
---
Completing a card IS the delivery: ``gateway/kanban_notifier.py`` posts a
terminal card's ``result`` into the subscribed chat thread as the answer to
whoever asked. On 2026-08-27 (issue #1010, eval ``capacity-pinned-pool-probe``,
build ``2093054394793725952``) the platform worker on ``t_470a97c5`` fanned
one investigation card out per cluster agent and then completed its own card
with::

    Fanned out cluster investigation tasks for `inference-server` to each
    cluster agent. Awaiting synthesis.

The gateway delivered that receipt, verbatim and marked "finished", as the
final answer. The question was never answered in the thread that asked it. A
sweep of 156 scored repetitions of the same case found the identical shape in
49 of them — different wording each time, so this is the protocol as the
worker understood it, not one bad sample.

The worker was doing what it was told: the fan-out guidance in
``agents/platform/SOUL.md`` said to file the per-cluster cards, file a fan-in
card, and "then complete your current card". Prompt guidance is also how the
two ancestors of this defect (#630, #802) were fixed, and both recurred. So
this patch enforces the delivery contract where it cannot be paraphrased away:
at the ``kanban_complete`` handler, the same seam ``kanban_result_required``
gates.

What this changes
-----------------
1. **The create handler records attribution.** A card created by a running
   worker (``HERMES_KANBAN_TASK`` set — the same definition of "worker" that
   ``kanban_auto_subscribe`` uses) is recorded in ``kanban_worker_children``
   as a child of the card that worker is running. Upstream stores no
   creator-of relationship: ``task_links`` is a *predecessor* edge, and the
   fan-out idiom deliberately creates children with no parents at all, so at
   completion time nothing else on the board connects the receipt to the work
   it dispatched.

2. **The complete handler checks it.** A completion of a card with recorded
   children that are neither settled (``done``/``archived``) nor gated on the
   completing card is refused once, with the instruction that fixes the run:
   wait for the children (poll ``kanban_show``, sleep between polls), then
   complete with the synthesized answer in ``result``. The error text is part
   of the fix — the worker reads it mid-run and self-corrects.

The exemption in 2 is load-bearing. Upstream's own continuation idiom —
"create a child of the current one (pass the current task id in ``parents``)
… then complete your own task" — files children that *cannot start* until the
completing card is done (``claim_task`` refuses them; see
``kanban_scheduling.py``). Refusing that completion would deadlock the board,
so a child with a ``task_links`` edge from the completing card is exempt.

Never wedging the card
----------------------
Same posture as ``kanban_result_required``, for the same reason: a gate that
can refuse forever is a worse bug than the one it fixes. The refusal is issued
at most once per :data:`NUDGE_TTL_SECONDS` per card; the retry is accepted
even if the children are still live. A worker at its iteration budget, or one
whose children are genuinely wedged, can still close its card — the guard
converts the silent contract violation into a corrected run when the model
cooperates, and into today's behaviour when it does not. It never converts it
into a stuck card. The deliberate cost: a worker that ignores the nudge and
resubmits its receipt unchanged ships the receipt, exactly as before the
patch.

A refusal never destroys the submitted text
-------------------------------------------
``kanban_result_required``'s module docstring records why its shape check was
deleted: a refusal that returns before ``kb.complete_task`` writes nothing,
so if the run ends between the refusal and the retry — a turn limit, a
cancellation — the only copy of the report dies with the worker's context.
This gate's window is wider than that one's was (the instruction is to poll
children for minutes, not to reformat), so it pays for its refusal up front:
the submitted ``result`` is stashed onto the card's ``result`` column, status
untouched, **before** the refusal is returned, and if that write fails the
completion is accepted instead — the gate refuses only when it has preserved
what it is refusing. A run that dies mid-wait therefore leaves the card open
with the best text available on it, which is strictly no worse than the
pre-patch behaviour of delivering that text as final; the accepted retry's
``kb.complete_task`` overwrites the stash with the real answer.

False positives, and why they are cheap
---------------------------------------
A worker can legitimately finish with a real answer while a card it spawned is
still running — follow-up work it queued for later rather than a piece of this
card's answer. Queued correctly (``parents=[<this card>]``) it is exempt.
Queued as a free-running card, the worker pays one nudge: it re-reads its
answer, resubmits, and the retry is accepted. One extra model turn — and only
the turn, because the refused submission is already stashed on the card —
bounded by the nudge memory. Set against a terminal "finished" message that
answers nothing — 31% of scored repetitions on the probe above — that trade
holds.

Fail-open throughout
--------------------
Every read here is advisory. A missing table (a board that predates the
patch), a locked database, a broken connection — anything short of a positive
"live children exist" lets the completion through, logged. A guard
bookkeeping failure must never block the one call that delivers a report.

Scope: the check lives in the ``kanban_complete`` tool handler, so the CLI and
the scheduler (``kb.complete_task`` direct writers) are unaffected — no cron
run and no human at a shell can be blocked by it. Attribution is written only
for creates made by a dispatcher-spawned worker, so an orchestrator filing
cards from a chat session (the Planning Agent's aggregation-card pattern in
``docs/designs/agent-communication.md``) is untouched.
