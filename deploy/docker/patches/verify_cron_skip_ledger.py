"""Build gate for the cron skip-ledger patch.

Run by ``deploy/docker/Dockerfile`` from ``/opt/hermes`` after
``apply_cron_skip_ledger.py``. The applier proves nineteen anchors matched and
that five files still parse; it proves nothing about whether a skip actually
reaches the ledger, and this patch fails silently in both directions if it does
not.

Two properties make a build-time gate non-optional here.

**The migration runs once, on a populated volume, in production.** The host
suite exercises it against a synthesised legacy database, but not through the
path that will invoke it: ``_initialize_schema``, inside ``_transaction``, with
WAL applied by ``hermes_state`` and ``PRAGMA synchronous=FULL``, and with the
two ``CREATE INDEX`` statements running after the table has been dropped and
rebuilt underneath them. So checks 2 and 3 lay down a byte-for-byte copy of the
schema the live boards carry and drive the real module over it.

**Every skip is written from a guard clause that must not raise.**
``record_skip`` swallows by design — a ledger write must never take a tick
down — so a mis-wired call site fails exactly like the bug it was meant to fix:
silently. Check 5 therefore drives ``tick`` and ``run_one_job`` themselves,
once per reason, and reads the ledger back.

The six checks:

1. SHAPE, ON THE REAL TREE. The prune is per job; ``_ensure_skip_schema`` runs
   before the indexes it invalidates; the ledger write in the in-process guard
   is outside ``_running_lock``; the cross-process guard and the
   ``create_execution`` failure path both release the running slot (and the
   latter the flock) before writing; ``_process_job`` no longer closes a lost
   fire claim as failed. Each is an ordering the applier's text match cannot
   see and a behavioural check would only catch under contention.
2. THE MIGRATION. Legacy DDL, rows in it, driven through ``list_executions``.
   Rows preserved, CHECK widened and still enforced, indexes back, scratch
   table gone, second pass a no-op.
3. THE WRITE PATH. ``record_skipped_execution`` and ``skip_execution``, and
   terminal-once still holding.
4. TELEMETRY. ``project_execution_event`` must not launder ``skipped`` into
   ``unknown`` — the state that means an owner process died mid-run.
5. THE SEVEN REASONS, END TO END. Three ``tick`` guards, a
   ``create_execution`` that raises under ``tick``, ``run_one_job``'s dispatch
   claim, a fire claim the worker loses inside ``tick``'s own pool, and a
   genuinely stale job store through the real ``cron.jobs.get_due_jobs``.
6. RETENTION. A flood of one job's rows must not evict another job's, which is
   the live failure this half of the patch exists to fix.
