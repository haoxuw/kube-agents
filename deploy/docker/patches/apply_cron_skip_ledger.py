"""Wire tools/cron_skip_ledger.py into the Hermes source tree.

Run by ``deploy/docker/Dockerfile`` against ``/opt/hermes``. Nineteen anchored
replacements across five files, with the same guarantee as every other patch in
that Dockerfile: each anchor must be found the exact number of times expected,
each edited file must still parse, and anything else fails the build loudly
rather than shipping a half-patched image.

**Must run after ``apply_cron_tick_lock_scope.py``.** Two of the anchors here
are text that patch inserts — the cross-process ``_job_locks.claim`` guard in
``tick``, and its counterpart in ``_run_claimed_job`` — so applying this one
first would fail on a missing anchor rather than silently mis-apply, but the
ordering is still load-bearing and the Dockerfile records it.

Why each edit is needed is documented in the module docstring of
``deploy/docker/patches/cron_skip_ledger.py``. Usage::

# --- tools/cronjob_tools.py: the dispatch path loses occurrences too --------
#
# Both refusals in ``_run_claimed_job`` sit after ``claim_job_for_fire`` has
# advanced ``next_run_at``, so each one drops a scheduled occurrence for a run
# that never happened — the same shape as the two guards in ``tick`` above, and
# recorded with the same two reasons.
#
# This became true at v2026.8.13. Before it, upstream had no in-flight dedupe
# here, and the kube-agents flock was taken *before* the CAS precisely so that a
# refusal cost nothing. The split into ``_run_claimed_job`` gave the run half
# four call sites, so the flock had to follow the run; the occurrence loss is
# the price, and ``tools/cron_skip_ledger.py`` exists to stop that price being
# paid silently.
#
# ``source="direct"`` rather than the ``"builtin"`` the tick guards use:
# ``run_one_job`` — the function these refusals stop us reaching — records its
# own executions as ``direct``, so a skip here is a refused manual/dispatched
# fire and reads as one in ``hermes cron runs``.
