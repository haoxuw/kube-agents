# Eval-driven development

[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) owns the rule: a change to what an agent does starts from a
failing eval case and ends with that case passing and registered. This file holds the mechanics.
Change the rule in `AGENTS.md`; change how it is done here.

## When it applies

Any pull request that changes what an agent does: a prompt, an SOP, a skill, a tool, the runtime
path an agent takes, or a fix for something an agent did wrong. A chart, operator, image or
configuration change that alters agent behaviour counts; "infrastructure" here means the pool
projects, the seeded fleet, Prow and the workflows. Exempt: docs, CI, that infrastructure, and the
bench harness itself (`bench/kube_agents_bench/`, `hack/ci-eval-pr.sh`). An exempt change says so
in one line under **Live validation** in the pull request body.

The loop needs a dev project with kube-agents installed ([`INSTALL.md`](../../INSTALL.md)),
refreshed to the commit under test: build the images with `deploy/docker/cloudbuild-ci.yaml`
(`gcloud builds submit` in your project, as `hack/ci-deploy.sh` does), then point the install at
them (`make -C k8s-operator install` and `deploy IMG=...`, then the `PlatformAgent` CR's image
and tag, as [`scripts/dev/dev_rebuild_agent.sh`](../../scripts/dev/dev_rebuild_agent.sh) does;
INSTALL.md "Method 3" is the local-iteration path). `hack/ci-deploy.sh` itself is the presubmit's path and assumes its
secrets. For cases that read the seeded fleet, whether through `fixtures:` or by naming
`seeded-a`/`-b`/`-c` directly, the fleet must be applied to the dev project once
([`bench/tf/fleet/README.md`](../../bench/tf/fleet/README.md)). Every contributor, human or
agent, is expected to have one. There is no path around the loop: a pull request that changes
agent behaviour without eval evidence is not ready for review.

## The loop

**1. Red.** Before writing the fix, name the case that shows the gap: an existing
`bench/tasks/<id>/task.yaml`, or a new one written to the case format
([`bench/CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../bench/CONTRIBUTING.md),
[`docs/designs/bench-case-format.md`](../../docs/designs/bench-case-format.md),
`make bench-case-check`). Run it against your dev install of current `main` with the exports the
presubmit uses (`hack/ci-eval-pr.sh`), without `--no-infra`, which skips the deterministic checks
and can produce neither a red nor a green:

```bash
cd bench && uv sync
export PROJECT_ID=<gcp project> CLUSTER_NAME=<cluster> AGENT_CLUSTER_CONTEXT=<kubectl context>
export BENCH_TF_ROOT=./tf
export GCP_PROJECT_ID="$PROJECT_ID"   # the judge: Vertex AI through your gcloud ADC, as in CI
PLATFORM_AGENT_TOKEN=$(kubectl --context "$AGENT_CLUSTER_CONTEXT" get secret platform-agent-secrets \
  -n kubeagents-system -o jsonpath='{.data.API_SERVER_KEY}' | base64 --decode) \
  JUDGE_PROVIDER=google JUDGE_MODEL=gemini-3.1-pro-preview \
  uv run devops-bench ./tasks/<id> --agent-type kubeagents
```

Without `GCP_PROJECT_ID` the judge fails to construct (`No API key was provided`); the eval
still needs the judge even though only the deterministic checks decide.

A case that reads the seeded fleet needs it in your dev project: run
[`hack/fleet-kubeconfigs.sh`](../../hack/fleet-kubeconfigs.sh) and export
`BENCH_FLEET_KUBECONFIG_DIR` first. Without the fleet the case fails every time with the fleet
phrases absent, which is broken, not red.

It must fail, and fail for the reason your change addresses. Keep the failing entry from
`verification_report[]` in the run's `results.json` (its `status` and `reason`) and the line of the
agent's report that shows the gap; the pull request quotes both. A case that passes before the
change proves nothing about it. A case that fails for an unrelated reason (a missing fixture, a
token, a 429) is not red, it is broken; fix that first or pick another case.

**2. Implement.**

**3. Green.** Deploy the branch to the same install (take the lease first if the install is
shared: [`pre_pr_review.md`](pre_pr_review.md), "Live validation") and run the same case three
times, the presubmit's repetition count; `devops-bench` runs a task once per invocation. All three
must pass on the deterministic checks; a judged score moving is not a pass. The check that was red
is the one that goes green: loosening the check in between is a new red, not a green. Keep the three
run directories; the pull request cites them.

**4. Register.** A new case is registered in `hack/ci-eval-pr.sh` in the same pull request, with
`owner:` set and a `docs/designs/domains.yaml` slug (or a reviewed `KNOWN_NO_DOMAIN` entry).
Which array is the Registration paragraph's call in
[`docs/designs/bench-case-format.md`](../../docs/designs/bench-case-format.md): `NIGHTLY_TASKS`
for a case you have seen red and green that is too slow for a presubmit seat or whose domain a
probe already covers there; `TASKS` for a fast case in an uncovered domain; commented out in
`TASKS` only for a case whose fixture is not ready yet. A case already registered stays where it is. Admission
to the blocking roster is earned on the case's record afterwards
([`docs/eval-gate-roster.md`](../../docs/eval-gate-roster.md),
[`bench/baselines/README.md`](../../bench/baselines/README.md)); never add a new case to
`BOOTSTRAP_ADMITTED` in the pull request that makes it pass.

## What the pull request records

Under **Testing → Live validation** in the template, which for a change to agent behaviour
is this loop and nothing less:

- the case id, and whether it is new or existing;
- red: the install and the `main` commit it ran against, the failing check and its reason, one
  line of the agent's report;
- green: the three runs (directories or a one-line summary each) against the branch's build;
- where the case is registered, or the one-line exemption.

## What does not count

- A unit test with a mocked model. That is a test; it goes where
  [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) "Where Tests Go" says, and it does not replace the case.
- A case run once, or a green you did not see. Three passing runs, observed.
- A red you did not see. If you cannot run the case before the change, you do not know it tests
  the change.

## Finding a case

[`bench/tasks/DRAFTS.md`](../../bench/tasks/DRAFTS.md) lists spec-ready scenarios per domain and
the planted defects the seeded fleet carries. The fleet is read-only: a case observes a defect
already planted; it never plants one from inside a run.
